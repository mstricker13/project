How did you know that he is married?
What exactly don't you get?
I don't know any French songs.
Can you measure the length?
I wouldn't dream of going on a picnic on such a rainy day.
Why can't animals talk?
We'll call you.
She can't have said such a thing.
Tom can get in touch with Mary by email.
Tom died in the explosion.
I'm just an average girl.
I'd say no if I were you.
Whenever Tom comes to Boston, he stays at our place.
The wind calmed down.
Where is this train going?
Tom should be here within fifteen minutes.
We knew one day it would happen.
Tom fried an egg.
Would you like to have some tea?
She greeted me with "Good morning."
I don't care what you're going to do tomorrow.
Tom is a telepath.
I finally met Tom today.
Let's try!
Who broke the cup?
I would've said yes.
So far, I haven't told anyone.
Tom was afraid of what people would think.
I found out where Tom lives.
Tom wasn't eating.
I met an old friend of mine.
That's sweet of you.
Tom asked Mary out.
All the windows were open.
Tom and Mary are going to get married next spring.
Tom was worried that he might be late.
I've got to stop eating such sweet ice cream.
I've been working.
What Tom did took courage.
I don't watch a lot of movies, but I can't resist a good documentary.
I was a little afraid.
I won't assist you.
I lost my bearings when I came out of the subway.
Tom turned the tap on.
I had hoped to have finished this yesterday.
Wake up Tom.
He'll play golf even if it rains.
I can't feel my toes.
They won't come back.
Please give me something to eat.
Tom spoke calmly.
I'm not sleepy.
Tom got dressed quickly.
What kind of help do you need?
He admitted his mistakes.
Does this cap belong to you?
This cat is as big as that one.
That's my dress.
He has a brother and two sisters.
He was kind enough to show me the way to the library.
If you don't have any ideas of your own then you just have to steal some.
I remember when we used to never eat vegetables that we didn't grow ourselves.
I can scarcely sleep at night.
Is it raining now?
Tom and Mary live in a bungalow.
Have you ever been to Hawaii?
I didn't mean to step on any toes.
This is sabotage.
We'll wait here.
I haven't said anything.
Tom said you're old friends.
You must stick to your promise.
He is accustomed to the work.
Could you get me another beer?
I don't like him because he loses his temper easily.
I didn't know you were so tired.
Tom had only three dollars on him.
He complained that his age was beginning to tell on him.
She speaks clearly enough to be easily understood.
The teacher pokes his nose into everything.
All the students forgot to read that book.
It is said that Friday the 13th is an unlucky day.
I want an explanation.
I wasn't allowed to help Tom.
Tom will be disappointed if you don't go to his party.
It was only a joke.
They aren't hungry.
She married a hotshot lawyer from New York.
The moonlight reflected on the lake.
Tom found out the truth from Mary.
It is abnormal to eat so much.
She can hardly speak.
I don't like onions.
Don't talk rubbish.
Please bring me a chair from the next room.
The train connections at this station are excellent.
We both know what happened.
This is an old book.
I don't want to play with you.
Don't run risks.
They are more or less the same size.
Please eat it while it's still hot.
I think Tom has finally fallen asleep.
I couldn't sleep because of the heat.
It could be anyone.
Tom knows what he's doing.
We don't know how or why.
This is a limited time offer to new customers only.
You've got to work really hard.
I hate reptiles.
I brought you some coffee.
Tom is a patient of mine.
Tom looks OK.
Tom needs to call a doctor.
If you don't want me to stay here, I'll leave.
That girl couldn't take things down in longhand, let alone shorthand.
I want you to go with me.
I'm going to Boston with Tom.
Somebody's coming.
You should go to bed. It's almost midnight.
You don't have to wrap it up.
Whose plan is it?
You have good ideas.
It may rain tomorrow.
She is very intelligent.
Has it arrived?
I will have him repair this watch.
I told them everything.
He has trouble remembering names.
Mireille Mathieu is one of France's best singers.
Can you really swim?
Tom was alone on the park bench.
Do you have any supernatural abilities?
I'm tired of your endless complaints.
I have nothing to hide.
She's well-informed, so she might know something.
I've never heard my mother sing a song.
Tom got into the car and slammed the door.
Does Tom know what he's doing?
You have to tell me the truth.
Why do you want to take a taxi?
He is what is called a self-made man.
Tom said he didn't know you.
I have the same number of books as he has.
I need to know.
Where does that idiot think he is going?
How clever!
Plain white paper will do.
Who do you think would be the best person for the job?
You never seem to get sick.
What a clever dog!
Tom's grandchildren were a source of great pleasure for him.
Do you still play hockey?
Who is calling, please?
If all goes to plan, I should be back home again tomorrow night.
He had an accident.
Is there anybody in there?
How could you humiliate me like that?
Are you on Facebook?
I think we should look into it.
Are you happy where you are?
When you're mad, count to ten before speaking.
Don't talk to your mother like that.
Do you have many hobbies?
We don't do things like that in Boston.
They laughed at me.
No one questioned anything.
Your outrage is completely justified.
The problem remains to be solved.
They looked at each other.
You may go anywhere you like.
Tom noticed Mary hadn't even started to cook dinner.
He is something like his father.
The dentist told me to open my mouth.
Tell me why he was absent.
We were all running short of money then.
What kind of food do you usually eat?
I always wondered whether you'd come back.
Don't forget to bring the camera with you.
I panicked.
Tom didn't seem too happy to see me.
You don't have to come tomorrow.
You ought to know that.
Are there any volunteers?
You had better stop smoking.
I don't know Tom's last name.
Did you hear about what's happened to Tom?
This soup is too thin for me.
He made me happy yesterday.
Aren't you going to do it?
She was crying.
Tom very rarely speaks French.
That's a contradiction.
What has become of your sister?
Would you like a room with a bath or a shower?
The train left before they got to the station.
Tom looks young, doesn't he?
We live near the border.
I didn't want to go to the reception.
I'm often here.
I don't really understand why.
Call your brother.
The urban population in most developing countries is increasing very fast.
The sand was so hot that it burned our feet.
Tom walked in the door at just the right time.
I'm taking the day off.
No one asked any questions.
I can't explain everything.
That man is Tom.
He'd never let me drive his car.
I was too small.
Don't put anything on top of the box.
I moved to Boston three years ago.
Playing the piano is her favorite pastime.
Do you know how to ride a horse?
I don't think anybody can help me anymore.
She came to Tokyo at the age of 18.
There is an album on the shelf.
Did you hear what I said to Tom?
There can be walls without a roof, but no roof without walls.
Tom wondered whether he should let Mary go to Boston with John.
I locked the door.
I find it hard to understand Tom.
Why do you keep provoking them?
Is lunch included in this price?
Tom realized Mary was deliberately avoiding him.
This gate needs painting.
Why didn't you call us?
Take care when you cross the street.
This book seemed interesting.
The small town, abandoned long ago, seems frozen in time.
I've spent 500 dollars in one day.
The sister of your father or mother is your aunt.
He answered my question with a "no."
I've done everything I was supposed to do.
Tom took the bottle from Mary and looked at the label.
This one is prettier.
Tom was an assistant professor.
Come and help me.
He's such a sweetheart.
My sister has long legs.
What are you good at?
Tom's house is at least twice as big as mine.
What language is this?
You do a great job.
Common sense is the collection of prejudices acquired by age eighteen.
Please take one.
Please don't get up.
You'll never guess who I just met.
These flowers bloom earlier than others do.
Don't worry about the past.
Tom's aware of what's happening.
Why don't you tell me what you're doing here?
She was deceived by a friend.
Who should I inform?
I'd rather you stayed at home.
If you get up early tomorrow, you can see the rising sun.
How old is your daughter?
Get on your knees.
I was deeply ashamed.
Tom showed interest in the plan.
That's not the only problem.
Tom is walking.
Who do you want to speak to?
I spoke to Tom just the other day.
There's no gold.
I have a lot of work to do today.
Where is the lost and found?
I really don't understand why.
I'm in Boston.
I didn't take many pictures on my trip.
Cocaine is a drug.
We're not going anywhere today.
You don't give up too easily, do you?
I was so hungry that I ate it.
You don't really mean it, do you?
I have to study for the exam.
I'm drowning.
Tom is gullible.
What is there to understand?
Tom is pretty good at chess.
Thanks for the advice.
Tom seems to be slightly annoyed.
Where were you an hour ago?
Since this heater seems to be out of order, I'll have him repair it.
Come on, Tom, aren't you just a little bit curious?
Tom's an irritating person to work with because he'll never admit it when he's made a mistake.
He is a type of a person who calls a spade a spade.
He didn't order dinner yet.
I want a suit made of this material.
It's big, isn't it?
Daddy, can you read me a story before I go to sleep?
I'll make you happy.
Have you taken your temperature?
Give me your phone number.
You'll get used to it.
I caught him trying to sneak out.
You think I don't know who you are, don't you?
These flowers are from our garden.
I'd like to watch this movie again.
What's the real reason you don't want to do this?
You're not as smart as you think you are.
He bent over the girl and kissed her.
Help yourself to a piece of cake.
The burglar broke into the post office in broad daylight.
Drive the nail into the board.
You don't have to stay to the end.
Smell this milk. Do you think it's gone bad?
He is tall, but his brother is much taller.
Tom has been doing this since he was a kid.
I ask not for a lighter burden, but for broader shoulders.
It was that dog that bit my hand.
If you are hungry, why don't you eat?
I know what they're like.
Tom has no idea what Mary is thinking.
Help yourself, please.
I couldn't control my anger.
It is better for you not to eat before you go to bed.
If he doesn't accept the job, someone else will.
Someone made a mistake.
I'm Tom's bodyguard.
Do you sell formal wear?
I told you Tom wouldn't want to go.
Everyone is unique.
I can't afford a car.
Did you telephone him?
Am I the only one here who doesn't speak French?
Tom says he'll call Mary next week.
Tom was sitting alone in the dark waiting for Mary.
I will send a letter to my brother who lives in Sapporo.
Don't worry about the cost.
He wanted to meet you.
Is there a photo shop in the hotel?
He wouldn't even lift a finger.
I can't believe that Tom just left without saying anything.
Are you mad at me?
I wonder what Tom is doing.
How large is the population of Shizuoka City?
I feel like another person.
Tom looks stuck.
The plan would've worked, if you hadn't interfered.
Soldiers must carry out their orders.
Tom's hands are small.
What have you been doing all this while?
It was wise of you to keep away from him.
Tom has to be here.
He made me so angry that I got a headache.
Why aren't you answering?
I need sunburn lotion.
Tom promised he'd never be late again.
I've never seen anything like this before.
I think Tom needs your help.
And that's how Tom met Mary.
Tom likes to drink.
Tom went to get a glass of water for Mary.
That is her car.
We will have to consider each application on a case-by-case basis.
Tom drank a cup of tea.
Wasn't she your girlfriend?
Don't be so greedy.
How long have you been in town?
You are more stupid than I thought.
This book isn't as heavy as that one.
We were too late.
The jurors came into the courtroom.
I do not play the piano.
I can't explain that either.
When I came home, Tom was studying.
What color are your wife's eyes?
Tom was wounded in a street fight.
How long will you be in Boston?
Please write down what I say.
The mother didn't know what to do with her son.
What is your ultimate goal in your life?
My mother insists that I should not go out after dark.
I can't help but think you're making a mistake.
Don't worry about it. Everything's going to be fine.
We dined at our uncle's.
She gave us a present.
Why is it here?
He's a talented writer.
Tom waited for three hours, but nobody came to pick him up.
This is not my car.
Didn't you like the movie?
I walk my dog along the river every morning.
I glanced at my watch.
I'm staying at the Sheraton Hotel.
Who wouldn't love to find one of these under the tree on Christmas morning?
Just listening to that song makes me think of you.
Tom is glad the school year is finally over.
Let me help.
I will go abroad next year.
I think you'll want this.
Everyone knows it's true.
I can't stand this noise any longer.
It could've been a trick.
Tom was drinking.
You guys seem to be having a good time.
Tom was better.
I'm surprised that Tom doesn't speak French.
I heard the children singing together.
They visited me occasionally.
We must do more to protect our cultural heritage.
Who would look after my children if I died?
Today, I am feeling a lot better.
It can't get worse.
I have to go to Boston with Tom.
I'll follow you anywhere.
What was Tom doing in there?
I've always wanted to meet you.
What is this?
Tom retired on October 20, 2013.
I'll gladly help you.
You seem to want to know what to do.
You'll probably find walking through that part of town interesting.
You need to read between the lines.
Tom and Mary have made up.
Both the boy and the girl are clever.
Why do you have two cars?
Tom clicked on the thumbnail so he could see a larger version of the same image.
She can't find her hat.
It doesn't look like Tom and Mary are going to get married.
This is the happiest I've ever been.
A good idea came to mind.
She says she brushes her teeth every morning.
Please give me a painkiller.
Tom and Mary have been in Boston for three years.
They went to an expensive restaurant for lunch.
He won't make it.
Tom didn't discuss the matter with Mary.
Tom is playing with his son.
Tom is wearing sunglasses.
Tom seemed to have been very busy.
I like to swim in the afternoon.
I have to disassemble this engine.
Tom was eager to speak to Mary.
Tom has told us quite a bit about you.
Tom died alone.
He filled the glass with wine.
I worked on a farm.
Tom isn't wealthy.
Tom wanted to kiss Mary goodbye, but knew he shouldn't.
I didn't feel particularly nervous.
This movie is incredibly stupid.
I've never heard that before.
She ironed his shirts.
There are many tourists in town.
I was wrongfully punished.
They aren't my books.
The old man got off the bus.
She looks like her mother.
I must have made a mistake somewhere.
Roll down your window.
Something seems to be wrong with this watch.
I'll need to download it.
The whole town was very clean.
Nobody wants you to do this.
I have faith in you, Tom.
The tickets sold out within a week.
You should consider moving to Boston.
I didn't know we weren't supposed to do that.
I've given up smoking.
Tom and Mary went to a fancy restaurant to celebrate their wedding anniversary.
How does Tom feel about it?
Leaves are to plants what lungs are to animals.
Smoking is banned in restaurants in California.
Tom admitted that he had been wrong.
This room smells musty.
She didn't have much money.
They hired someone else for the job.
I don't think Tom knows that.
"How many girls do you have?" "I only have one."
Tom overheard us.
You don't need to look for it anymore.
She is an educated girl.
I won't go back there.
Your skin is so soft.
I can not afford to keep a car.
I'll come by 10.
Tom looked out the window and saw Mary playing with her dog.
It's well done.
I'm hiding.
Don't you think that Tom is a little too young to be doing that?
Oranges have a lot of vitamin C.
I love animals.
The sky has become clear.
That road is still under construction.
I expect that Tom will do more.
I was devastated.
I have a pain in my foot.
I am a translator.
Have you ever seen a lion?
What you say makes no sense.
They're carnations.
French is my favorite subject.
The mayor presented him with the key to the city.
Do you know something about this?
He lost his parents in a plane accident.
If you trust such a fellow, you'll lose everything you have.
Aren't you going to eat with us?
This book is heavy.
You knew I knew.
Do you miss your friends?
I'm beginning to regret not studying French harder.
Tom is a computer programmer.
Valentine's Day is celebrated all around the world.
I had to make a speech at short notice.
I'm going to swim every day.
There was no one at all in the whole house.
I don't like what Tom is doing.
Could I talk to you for a minute?
Today is too hot for sunbathing.
Tom works on an oil rig.
Tom's a natural when it comes to games involving hand-eye coordination.
It was nothing less than a miracle.
Cats are smart.
Do you understand what I mean?
He secretly showed me her photograph.
Do you believe global warming is the result of human actions?
The higher we went, the colder it became.
Tom looked discouraged.
We need to speak with you.
You know Tom is telling the truth.
This doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
Tom asked a few good questions.
Isn't that mine?
It is just your imagination.
Bears can climb trees.
I don't know why Tom gave up.
As soon as I finish writing the report, I'll send it to you.
I wish you didn't have to leave.
My father often falls asleep while watching TV.
I can't imagine how Tom has put up with Mary all these years.
This was a great idea.
It's what I want.
Her new novel has been highly praised.
Tom picked up the remote control.
Why doesn't Tom want to do that?
I feel like eating something sweet.
Is Tom breathing?
Do you have anything to say regarding this?
Where's Tom anyway?
Tom was almost run over by a dump truck.
Do you want to go home now?
I study psychology.
I located the town on the map.
Is Tom intrigued?
Let's not jump to conclusions.
Tom is definitely not stupid. He's just lazy.
Tom has a map.
Where is the post office?
Tom is going to buy a new computer.
Do you have my money or not?
Because of the snow, I couldn't see anything.
What's the safest way to get to the top of the mountain?
Tom is indiscreet.
I'll go at three, or rather at a quarter past three.
I hate Tom's guts.
I don't want to ever see you again.
She loves chocolate, too.
I will play football tomorrow.
Honesty sometimes doesn't pay.
I can't wait to meet you all.
I know what your first thought was.
I like bananas more than apples.
Tom got a bargain price.
Did you go to the doctor?
You don't seem to understand anything.
I won't bother you again, I promise.
I don't think that he's honest.
Tom didn't say what he did that made you so angry.
Mom is older than Dad.
You're not going to do that, are you?
Everyone likes her.
Do you have kids?
How did you spend your holiday?
The high command decided to attack at dawn.
What do you think they are?
She's very ill and has been in bed for a week.
Was there something else you wanted?
What did Tom just tell you?
That's enough.
Behave yourself.
Are these your horses?
When will you have the report ready?
I won't go.
How am I going to protect my children now?
I will hit the sack.
He turned on the radio.
I've never read a novel in French.
Tom is very close to Mary.
Tom is going to like being in Boston.
Am I safe here?
He worked hard in order to support his family.
Will you pay attention, please?
We'll have to be careful not to play into his hands.
All of them are good, so choose three books.
Can you guess where I am right now?
The problem is worse than we thought it was.
I went to Bali on summer holiday.
It's cool today.
They crossed over the bridge.
You're welcome to wait.
It was not until I read the book that I knew about it.
I have every reason to believe that he is innocent of the crime.
We managed to swim across the river.
We started before sunrise.
Tom's health is improving.
May I take your picture?
What would you do if I weren't here?
Tom is still uncertain about whether to go to college or not.
No one will believe him.
It's getting light. Morning is coming.
I talked to him on the telephone yesterday night.
They're lying to us.
I'd like to ask you about a car you repaired.
Just keep your promise.
I wanted to give up.
Tom didn't intend to hurt anyone.
You are not to blame for the accident.
Please make yourself at home.
Why do we have to help Tom?
I simply don't believe you.
Tom is the man Mary met the other day.
Can you manage to complete the manuscript by Friday?
Tom seemed to be illiterate.
I wish that wasn't the case.
Do you have any other questions?
Forget about Tom.
Tom will call back.
Tom is packing his suitcase.
Keep an eye on the bags.
Tom said he'd do that for Mary.
Can we put this incident behind us?
I'll come by.
All three of us were at Tom's party.
They agreed to work together on the project.
It's starting to snow.
Tom is very private.
He may have missed the plane.
What do you want to give Tom?
Tom still remembers you.
There is nothing interesting in the newspaper.
Tom took the wrong bus.
Tom likes vanilla ice cream.
Have you already decided how you're going to take care of this problem?
Regardless what he does, he does it well.
Here are some interesting links.
Tom can spell better than Mary.
You don't like gambling, do you?
Tom used to bake us cookies.
I didn't expect her to ask me that question.
The prophecy came true.
I saw a horse galloping toward me.
I didn't believe Tom at first.
You don't have to tell it to me if you don't want to.
I'll buy you a drink.
It's a bit wobbly.
Tom says he'll do whatever we do.
I think Tom wouldn't mind.
Have you ever climbed Mt. Aso?
They're going.
Many people shop here.
It snowed yesterday.
That was a pretty stupid thing to say.
Tom can't move.
Printing more money is a short-term measure used by some countries to pre-empt inflation, but, in the long term, it makes the situation worse.
I'm working on that.
I took a cab to the station.
I know who we're dealing with.
I wish none of this had ever happened.
You've got each other.
Where's the boss?
He was challenged to a drinking contest.
He was standing at the door.
Tom didn't know who to believe.
You should wait inside.
It's nearly impossible.
Don't be nervous.
I regarded the man as an enemy.
What a pity!
The work calls for patience.
I'll miss you after you've gone.
I think that Tom isn't a very good singer.
It's not like you think.
You'd better not go today.
Her wishes, it seems, have come true.
Tom is OK, isn't he?
How could Tom be so stupid?
Mary unscrewed her lipstick.
The baby cried for milk.
Have you heard from your sister lately?
You can do it, can't you?
The police found out where the criminal lived.
How long will this rain go on?
Tom got upset and left.
Please remain seated.
I didn't ask Tom to go there.
I'm sure he has other skills.
I made you a bracelet.
Tom appeared to be bewildered.
A strong draft's blowing in through that window.
Tom doesn't remember if he locked the door.
He was eighty-two years old and feeling his age.
Can you come?
I'll visit my uncle in Boston next month.
Don't climb on this!
Go and look for Tom.
We must do something.
Tom knows what Mary is doing.
Mistakes happen.
Tom is usually home on Mondays.
We differed as to the solution to the problem.
I'm a cancer patient.
I can't remember where I parked my car.
As everyone knows, he is a genius.
Give this book to whoever wants it.
Do you think that I'm handsome?
I came for Tom.
She attacked him with a pair of scissors.
There's someone in the basement.
If I were younger, I would go abroad to study.
You'd be better off without me.
His old car is on its last legs.
I'm passionate about my job.
I'm looking for something to clean the carpet with.
Do you have anything to add?
I am far from pleased with your behavior.
She refused to accept his proposal.
It isn't true.
I expect to come.
Did you check this?
Tom was arrested for driving while drunk.
How did it go?
I waited for fifteen minutes.
There's no doubt that he's English.
She keeps complaining that she doesn't have time.
Do you want to watch the baseball game on TV?
I'll need to think about it.
I like to study French.
I took that picture a week ago.
Tom looked up from his book.
She tries to keep up with what is going on in the world.
Do you really think Tom is going to be there?
A fish leaped out of the water.
She has very few close friends.
I'll tell him that.
How did you arrive at this conclusion?
Can you show me the house?
I'm a salesman.
I don't know when I'll be back.
What did Tom give you in return?
She is an excellent student.
Are you willing to drive me to the station?
You thought I wouldn't notice?
Why did you bring it?
I worked in a post office during the summer vacation.
Tom practiced hard to make the team.
Do you like my friend?
I have already done this several times.
Where is the nearest internet cafe?
I'll decide.
I wish you wouldn't do that.
Please write down everything I say.
It's probably just my imagination.
You're after Tom.
Tom's work is sloppy.
Tom didn't seem very busy.
Tom started studying French last year.
Why would Tom want to go there?
She cooks for him.
Let Tom do it.
Tom didn't just sprain his ankle. He broke three of his toes.
Very few people know it.
You're always busy.
Do you still enjoy watching cartoons?
I can't afford to buy an expensive car.
Tom can't remember his kindergarten teacher's name.
I don't have a home.
You can't count on his help.
Are you really going on the date with Tom?
Tom's purpose in college is to get a degree.
Tom was just a little boy at that time.
At last, the truth was revealed to us.
He delivered a speech.
My wife is hiding something from me.
Do you have a daughter?
I won't eat breakfast today.
I lost interest in my work.
Tom is older than Mary.
He was playing the piano and she was singing.

Mistakes like these are easily overlooked.
The cat clung to her dress.
I don't know when Tom will come.
I hope I don't have to use this pistol.
Can you help us?
You can't just lie to Tom.
Don't you have any ambition?
Please send me a picture of yourself.

Tom is cultured.
Tom said that he was feeling thirsty.
Maybe he'll come tomorrow.
He took a taxi in order not to miss the train.
She is about your age.
What if I'm wrong?
You won't find anyone who'll do that for you.
It isn't what he says that annoys me but the way he says it.
You must remain calm.
I've been thinking of you all day.
Are you asking me for something?
Tom thought we should leave early.
Her voice is pleasant to listen to.

Can you please reduce the volume of the music?
You look very pale.

It'll come in handy.
I doubt if Tom would do that.

I have been busy since yesterday.
Call me if you need assistance.
I'm pretty sure I'll pass the test tomorrow.
This is the first volume of a series on modern philosophy.

I wish you'd stop doing that.

Tom climbed down from the tree.
Have you ever seen a koala?

There are downsides to being pretty.
I'll get there at about 2:30.
You've made your position clear.
Such behavior can cause an accident.
Tom seems intelligent.
I want to deal with this letter before I do anything else.
We're going home by car.
She will come if you ask her.

What kind of book did you buy?
I had a recent conversation with my neighbor.

I think you're very cute.
This is a good system.
He wasn't stupid enough to talk about that while she was around.
How many Canadian friends do you have?

In other words, he betrayed us.

Is that true?
You ought to know that.

I don't always do this.
In any case, I'll call you tomorrow.

There's a place I'd like to show you.
Keep a close eye on him.
Can you order it for me?
Tom is very good-looking.
You sure seem happy tonight.
If you're going to go to France, you should brush up on your French.

What's their plan?
I had no idea what to do.

It's been raining for about a week.
She is always busy.
Lock the door.
Tom is hiding something from me, too.
I don't trust you anymore.
Tom said that he didn't know Mary could speak French.
I have the feeling that my French isn't getting much better.
We'll read this book until the end of the year.
Drive slowly.
Let's talk about why you're here.
I thought you said Tom and Mary were married.
I hear what you're saying.
He is in a bad mood.
It was nothing but the shadow of a tall tree.
There is an urgent need for clean energy.
Tom washed the car.
Tom didn't even know how to write his own name.
Your cat is overweight.
Have you made up your mind to come with me?
Tom isn't accustomed to walking barefooted.
Things didn't go according to plan.
Hello everyone!
She decided to keep a diary.
Tom told me that he hadn't done that yet.
Do you want this shirt?
Tom doesn't know why Mary was in a bad mood this morning.
I said I'd get it.
I believe Tom can do that.
I think I know what you're trying to tell Tom.
You are doing very well. Keep it up.
I'll show that to Tom.
Tom speaks French well, but not as well as he speaks English.
Tom told me that he often drinks root beer, but he'd not only never drunk spruce beer, he'd never even heard of it.
Keep the door locked.
Some stores discount the price.
Tom doesn't like Mary doing that.
This coat looks loose on me.
How did Tom respond?
She wanted him to sing her a song.
Do it by yourself.
As far as I know, he is honest and reliable.
It's not always possible to eat well when you're traveling in this part of the world.
We were told by him to leave the room at once.
The magazines were sold out.
She talks as if she knew everything.
When do you go back to Japan?
This tree is about as tall as that one.
Could you please bring me a clean knife?
I talked to Tom just the other day.
I am warming myself by the fireplace.
Is everybody happy?
The light bulb has burned out.
Those were the saddest hours of my life.
Tom realized Mary was unhappy.
Isn't that enough for you?
The bridge collapsed when one of the cables snapped.
He has already begun.
This material stretches easily.
Texting while crossing the street is dangerous.
You're late again.
He is good at soccer.
I'll remain your ally no matter what happens.
Is there a place I can smoke?
I like to buy clothes.
He is a doctor and also a novelist.
I'm sorry I ever doubted you.
How old do you think Tom is?
I suggest you stay out of my way.
I never have had occasion to use it.
I've been bitten by a snake.
The ears of a rabbit are longer than those of a fox.
He is hated.
Tom wanted Mary to understand why he couldn't live with her.
It is said that he is sick.
Do you want another one of these?
If you need any money, I'll lend you some.
This book is yours.
We worry about your future.
Tom looks curious.
Don't give in.
We wrote to each other.
I forgot to turn off the light.
A little more effort, and you will succeed.
Tom sounded as excited as Mary did.
Tom doesn't like to speak in public.
Where did you see Tom?
He seems to have no sense of humor.
I wonder what Tom and Mary have in common.
You said that Tom wasn't hungry.
This apple is sweet.
Tom certainly speaks eloquently.
I walked about aimlessly on the street.
The door is locked.
Will you go by train?
I won't help you.
I do some work for Tom from time to time.
What little money I had was stolen.
You really know your stuff, Tom.
Tom couldn't swim.
Please don't pry into my personal affairs.
Is my French really that bad?
Tom took his headphones off.
Don't take things too seriously.
We met a writer.
Tom wants what Mary has.
The man spoke in a low voice.
I miss that place.
Too bad you have to leave already.
Tom told me that I could keep the book if I wanted it.
This is a fascinating book.
I want you to drive to Boston.
We're just hanging out.
Tom was about to get into his car when he was shot.
Perhaps I will never see you again.
I worked hard all day, so I was very tired.
Wait, why are you here?
Tom can't read.
I am certain that he will pass the exam.
I've rented a room in Paris for a month.
Tom handed Mary a glass of red wine.
Tom is smarter.
The food was nearly inedible.
Go upstairs right now and clean your room.
What I have to tell you is very important.
Let's see what Tom has to say about Mary's plan.
What changes the world is communication, not information.
My brother is an idiot.
He knows how to spend his money.
They meant well.
They have nothing in common with us.
Would you like me to explain it to you?
Your room is bigger than mine.
Why don't you both come out here and look for yourselves?
I need to buy Christmas gifts.
To some extent I agree with you.
Tom talked to Mary as well.
I'd like to apply for a job.

Tom is putting the children to sleep.
Tom is falling.
I bought this book yesterday.
I refused at first.
Why is life so full of suffering?
We had better not remain here.
I don't care what you want.
Next Friday, I'm going on a date with a girl named Mary.
This car was made in Japan.
Nothing is more valuable than friendship.
Do I detect sarcasm?
It is not very polite, either.
We really did try.
The teacher has three times as many books as I do.
He finally found his calling.
Tom started taking things out of the box.
Those are Tom's.
I know you don't remember me.
Tom didn't know what to do first.
How did this misunderstanding ever arise?
Do you think we have any chance of winning?
Do we have to go now?
Most Japanese eat rice at least once a day.
You know enough.
It was a good opportunity.
What time is your flight home?
You have to be prepared for anything.
Do you know how Tom is doing?
These boys are not good at speaking to girls.
I felt that my honor was at stake.
He shot at me.
Tom looks irritated.
Tom knows what's really going on.
Tom is very sorry.
Earth is the third planet from the sun.
You can't live on that island.
Tom fought hard.
Tom started to feel like his life wasn't worth living.
Why is this my job?
I don't like this song.
You lost, didn't you?
You might find this interesting.
Tom didn't want to know about my problems.
I will take you for a swim.
We provided them with money and clothes.
Please let me go home.
We should run some tests.
He drives a truck.
There is not much hope.
You sent me your photo.
I'd like to go to Boston.
I can't decide whether to join that club.
He's ten years older than you.
Tom did it for the money.
Tom made Mary swim.
She graduated in 1996.
Tom seems to have calmed down a little.
Would you like to go to the theater this evening?
Every now and then I like to have hot and spicy food.
Let me show you how to chop onions without crying.
I heard you got a new car.
I disagree with you on the matter.
We should play squash together sometime.
Just relax. Everything's going to be all right.
He brought his lunch today.
I think you're right.
I don't have the foggiest idea.
I'll leave the planning to you.
Tom showed Mary a lot of his pictures.
Money can't buy happiness. However, it's more comfortable to cry in a Maserati than on a bike.
I may be living in Australia next year.
Tom would never hurt his children.
You have to go on living.
Gambling is illegal.
I'm sure you misunderstood what was said.
Tom slept under mosquito netting.
What should we tell the others?
Did you want to sit down?
Tom and Mary arrived in a horse-drawn carriage.
You can put it anywhere.
What do you know about him?
I hope it's true.
Just call me Tom.
She acted in a play for the first time.
The next flight is at 10:00.
Tom sat next to Mary on the tailgate.
Some people say Japan is a male-dominated society.
Please lend me your book.
Close the door, please.
How long does it take to get there by bus?
Please wrap it up.
He has to get up immediately.
I'll pop in tomorrow morning.
You have betrayed us.
I'd like to be with Tom.
She is a runner.
Tom begged Mary not to say anything.
We can't be too careful.
Tom isn't the right man for this job.
He is opening the window.
There was a detour on the road.
Having met him before, I recognized him at once.
What do they know?
"Where's your cousin?" "She's just left."
Do you wear glasses?
As a result of the collision, one of the passengers was thrown out.
She was buried in her hometown.
Why do we have to do this?
Tom believes it's absolutely necessary to drink at least a liter of water every day.
I guess it doesn't make any difference which swimming club I join.
I can't even walk, let alone run.
Are you sure you remember everything?
I have seen Mt. Fuji.
I think my French is really bad.
Tom dreamed that Mary had left him.
Tom is awake now.
Tom tried to stay calm.
Tom is amazing.
It's definitely starting to rain.
Tom was asleep in the hammock, snoring quietly.
Tom felt nothing.
I know you don't like me.
He is proud of his family.
I'm very happy with my new car.
There's so much I want to show you.
This is a good suggestion.
I can't face Tom today.
Do you believe Judas betrayed Jesus Christ?
Tom is wasting his time.
The actress looks younger than she really is.
Tom isn't thinking about that.
Tom attacked Mary with a dagger.
Guess how much that cost me.
Why didn't you show up at the party last night?
Pretend you know something.

Tom is very important.
They discussed the problem.
Paper is a Chinese invention.
Tom fought.
He's done his homework.
She made me a cake.
Tom shut the kitchen door.
Do you have a best friend?
Tom took his shirt off.
Where is my plate?
They oppose the plan to raise taxes.
This town is increasing in population.
Excuse me, how much are these?
Listen, I need your help.
This temple is famous for its cherry blossoms.
Why are you looking for Tom?
There's a paper they want you to sign.
Carrots are good for your eyes.
What are your plans?
Please take your time before deciding what to do.
We don't mean any disrespect.
Tom will be away for at least a week.
Kanako commutes from Chiba to Tokyo.
There's no point talking to you, because you won't do as I say anyway.
You don't have to hurry.
I know where to find water.
Why didn't you tell us about this sooner?
Tom called in sick.
I love what I do.
I couldn't do that last week because I was in Australia.
Please drink the beer before it goes flat.
Don't let Tom leave before I get there.
I consulted a doctor.
We have tried everything.
Does that float your boat?
Tom's dog's name is Cookie.
Forty-eight sailors are on the ship.
This ship is too big to pass through the canal.
Today, I saw a starling.
I wish you didn't have to leave.
He still has much to learn.
I didn't mean to sound so harsh.
We're winning.
Tom doesn't need to worry about Mary.
I intend to do that by tomorrow.
Isn't that what Tom said to Mary?
I found my father's diary that he kept for 30 years.
That is my dog.
I know who lives in that house.
I have a nasty feeling something's gone wrong.
Have you ever seen Mt. Fuji? It is beautiful beyond description.
He wanted to buy a book.
Tom is very picky about what he eats.
Put your helmet on.
Hotels are cheaper in the off season.
She waits tables for a living.
I'm a stranger here myself.
Tom always needs to have the last word.
I wish Tom would smile more often.
Tom says he doesn't like doing that.
I just want to make sure that doesn't happen again.
You used to look up to your father.
I thought you were going to wear your new suit.
Tom doesn't drink.
She was a middle-aged woman.
Five patients were in the waiting room.
Send Tom to me.
The stranger was too surprised to speak.
The house only needs minor repairs.
I saw a spider walking on the ceiling.
I didn't know about that until quite recently.
You wanted this to happen, didn't you?
Everyone is entitled to his own opinion.
You have to listen to Tom.
You're better able to do it than I am.
I only eat vegetables that I grow myself.
Tom is a little moody today.
I'll be here until next week.
We often fail to realize the extent to which we depend on others.
The boy will wait for you till you come back.
I considered Tom.
I want you all to be on your best behavior.
What motivated you?
I know Tom would love to see you.
You can go if you want to.
Why don't you let Tom decide?
I wonder why nobody told me.
All essays must be handed in on time.
Where's your money?
Is Tom your brother?
You have no right to do this.
Where will you stay in Boston?
An old woman was burnt to death.
Can I please have something hot to drink?
I should like to go for a swim.
Tom says he doesn't think he could do that.
We have to think about our children.
Dinner is ready.
Didn't I tell you that you needed to study harder?
This is a work in progress.
I'll be going on a picnic with Tom and his family next weekend.
We took Tom home.
This is something we cannot do without.
It was a problem difficult to solve.
Maybe Tom tried too hard.
My brother goes fishing every weekend.
He is always a little irritable in the morning.
He refused to pay.
This is like fighting someone with one arm tied behind your back.
He passed the entrance examination.
How much for half a kilo?
Tom is one of the bravest men I've ever known.
We are spending the night at my uncle's house.
How do I report a theft?
Tom converted about half of his yen into dollars and the other half into euros.
You have a secret admirer.
Tom could be a farmer.
She pulled the curtain aside.
Whose umbrella is this?
Did you speak at all?
Can you handle it?
He has bad eyes.
Tom asked Mary and her friends for help.
Listen to this!
Tom is waiting for you.
She is used to getting up early.
We're about the same height.

They aren't children any more, but not adults yet.
A group of teenagers robbed me of my money.
I even tried writing a song about what happened.
You are ten times better looking than I am.
I don't want to drink anything cold.
You always complain about the weather.
What surprised me was that Tom didn't know Mary.
Did we have any English homework that needs to be done by tomorrow?
Tom may not make it.
I haven't yet done what you said you wanted me to do.
Are you absolutely sure?
One of the children left the door open.
Kissing a person who smokes is like licking an ashtray.
Tom would probably still be in Boston if he didn't have to be in Chicago.

Tom doesn't look like a professor.
You seem to be relieved.
I can't believe I just said that.
I know all your secrets.

I bought the same shirt as yours.
I know which of the two girls you like better.
I love you just as you are.
She was now out of danger.
Tom said that he thought it wouldn't be possible to do that.
Nobody spoke with me.
I can do breaststroke but not backstroke.
No sooner had she entered her room than she began to cry.
Tom's love for Mary probably won't last.

Therapy didn't work.
Tom married Mary's sister and Mary married Tom's brother.
I think he likes you.

I'll take it home with me.
A computer is a complex machine.
Tom asked Mary if she really wanted to do that by herself.
I gave Tom one of those.
I can't trust what she says.
She was injured in the traffic accident.
The evidence suggests the opposite is the case.
Tom said you were hungry.
Tell her that I am sick.
Would you like a second helping?
Do I owe you something?
I wouldn't have been able to do it without you.
Who are you talking about?
He's allergic to cats.
Where will you be?
The whole is worth more than the parts.

January is usually the coldest month.
Is this the right way to the station?
Tom closed his eyes and tried to concentrate.
I hope you'll like it.
This window won't open.
We made a good buy.
Be careful what you say.
To the man who only has a hammer in the toolkit, every problem looks like a nail.

He entered the garden secretly.
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.

Go straight, then turn right.
I know that look.
It needs washing.

Please prepare for the trip.
What does Tom owe you?
I really have to go now.
We stayed at an economy hotel.
We work from dawn until dusk.
I was sleeping.
Do you think there's any chance that Tom knows Mary's phone number?
His hobby is painting pictures.
Don't you think it's time for you to settle down?
She lives within a stone's throw of the school.
I could use some help here.
Mary shrieked.
Does anyone here understand French?
I saw more than Tom knows.
Is there a fee?
Have you ever read a book in French?

You're being evasive.
He talked to a high official of the Treasury Department.
Tom is back to square one.
Never mind!
Tell her that I am taking a bath.
I hope to hear from you.
Tom never mentioned it to me.
She's a powerful witch.
That's a great idea!
It took me five hours to read through this book.
I'm sorry. That's really all I remember.
Tom and Mary liked each other instantly.
Tom blames you for the death of his wife.
Tom moved away from the group.
That disease is caused by bacteria.
I think Tom might've said something he shouldn't have.
Daddy, let's make faces at each other and see who can keep from laughing the longest.
Tom hoped that he would become a famous writer.
Happy Easter!
How did Tom know that?
I don't know him.
Could I borrow your car?
I visited Tom.
I didn't think it was a big deal.
What a loser!

I couldn't fall asleep because of the noise.
Do you know what these are?
Tom opened his eyes.
I accidentally threw an expensive knife into the trash.
I can't spend the rest of my life living with Tom.
We cannot thank you enough.
The export of arms was prohibited.
Why didn't you get married?
Tom is hiding.
