I no longer like you.
Do you know a good dentist?

We'd better stop.
Cheer up!
Tom was exactly twelve minutes late.
I bought some Christmas presents today.
I don't like people who get angry easily.

Every cloud has a silver lining.
I wasn't at home when Tom dropped by.
A strong wind was blowing.
This is priceless.
He is not ashamed of being poor.

I need you to do it yourself.
I'll deal with this problem as soon as I can.
My father will kill me.
I could agree with you, but then we'd both be wrong.

I'll meet him tomorrow.
I'm very glad to see you again.
She rejected his offer of help.
The accomplishment of this task took many years.
Would you excuse me?
I don't know either of his brothers.
Taking things apart is easier than putting them back together.
I think you are mistaken.
Maybe Tom was hiding something.
Do you want beef or pork?
Can I make myself useful somehow?
I don't really know why, but they don't like me.
Tom said he wished he hadn't told Mary to try to convince John to do that.
I'm still not talking to you.
Tom is flabbergasted.
No one said anything.
Don't tell Tom what you've seen here.
I just don't like football.
Your opinion is quite different from mine.
I'll be there at 2:30, OK?
Tom gave Mary flowers.
The windows are open.
Tom rarely laughs.
Who is taller, Tom or Mary?
Stop screaming in my ears.
Let's try once again.
How about a snack?
It's the best house in town.
I am talking to my sister.
Is it difficult eating with chopsticks?

He has much more money than I have.
We're almost out of sugar.
Let me see what's in your hand.
I get up early.
I can't let you do that.
I don't believe you can do it.
You ought not to have kept her waiting on such a cold night.
I didn't know Tom had a sense of humor.
They can understand me.
It was a one hundred dollar bill.
I read your book.
For here, or to go?
This isn't French.
I saw it on TV.
Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take, but by the moments that take our breath away.

Tom is unstable.
This storm is not dangerous. You don't need to worry.
I returned home from Boston yesterday.
There is no need for you to stay here.

You can sleep here if you want.
This is by far the best way.
I can't wait to get out of here.
Tom wanted his money back.
Tom is trying to trick you.
He can run faster than I can.
I am memorizing a text.
Are you saying that I'm a liar?
Tom must've been lying.
He reminds me of somebody.
Have courage.
Fifteen more minutes and I'll be out of here.
Do you wish you could travel in space?
The soldier became a teacher.
We have no idea what to do.
I'm allergic to fish.
All right, I'll do it.
Tom was alerted.
My uncle has a deep interest in art.
Does Tom know why you don't like him?
You're not telling me anything I haven't already heard.
I left the window open all through the night.
Tom was completely devastated when he heard that Mary had been killed.
What would you do in this situation?
I think that recording is important.
I almost never met her.
We've seen it before.
I wonder if Tom has ever considered going to a specialist.
Is there someplace around here that can fix a flat tire?
Can you make it before the deadline?
This is a lion.

There is no situation that is without hope.
I hope Tom says no.
I don't know why it happened.

Do you really think that's true?

He's very understanding.
What's the fax number for this hotel?
Go on Tom, drink it.
Could I get a receipt?
Seeing me, they suddenly stopped talking.
You've seen what Tom can do.
Tom arrived shortly after 10 o'clock.
Where are you from?
Tom tossed the book on the couch.
He is a good carpenter.
We have more important things to do right now.
You're very kind, Tom.
This dog bites.
Do you want us to take you home?
Tom sometimes walks to work.
What's your least favorite food?
Tom felt humiliated.
I'm not married to Tom anymore.
What would you change?
It's the first time that anybody said something like that to me.
Tom refused Mary's offer to drive him home.
The weather was so cold that the lake froze over.
What's the scariest thing you've ever done?
I hope you had a good night's sleep.
I'll eat something light.
Tom signed the contract this morning.
He put his head out of the window.
You must not come into the kitchen.
We're very sorry.

Tom's cellphone rang.
I'm just stating the obvious.
Would you like to see it now?
He would be glad to hear that.
I’m on a diet at the moment.
You need to believe in something.
Tom is practical.
Didn't he tell you who he was?
Isn't that enough for you?
He was acting on orders.
Do you know something I don't know?
I have an older brother and an older sister.
I'm sorry, I can't help you.
Turn off the radio, please.
Get out of my room.
I need to learn French.
What would Tom say if he were here?
My boss praised me for my hard work.
Tom wanted to turn himself in.
Tom gave Mary some good advice.
I don't know why Tom doesn't want to go sailing with us next week.
What's your location?
I'm dying to know what's inside.
I wanted to be the first to congratulate you.
Do you know this part of the city very well?
Sit tight.
Tom should've stayed a little longer.
Your timing's perfect.
I think I'll come back soon.
Tom gives us money.
The soup is too salty.
No animals are to be found on the island.

How did he come here?
Tom is a racist.

How long have you waited?
There are holes in the roof.
There was more than enough food.

My camera is the same as your camera.
I think your answer is correct.
You dropped something.
Tom eats rice almost every day.
Walk ahead of me.
What's your advice?
Her kindness was misunderstood.
I'd like a daiquiri.
No one knows why.
Do you have much money with you?
We knew you were sick.
Do you have any idea where Tom put the keys?
How are you getting along with your work?

What's your favorite color?
I've finished reading that book.
What do you have in this bag?
Have you ever watched this film?
Give me a hand, will you?

I have a very bad earache.
This is by far the better of the two.
How did you find out?
I will get it for you.
I have to go there myself.
Tom was carjacked.
I've got a class in a few minutes.
You guys are dangerous.
You are blushing.
I arrived at the village before dark.
I'm not in any hurry.
I think I'm ready to leave.
I'd never played that game before.
I live here.
Thanks for coming.
You can eat lunch here in this room.
You can rest.
What's bugging you?
Did you say thank you?
Stop dreaming.
I'm not as smart as you.

How would you like it if someone did that to you?
He twisted my arm.
I'm standing.
We're the best.
I'm not going to go with you.
No, I'm not a teacher. I'm only a student.
I hope the bread keeps until tomorrow.
I expect much of him.
Tom couldn't imagine himself shooting anyone.
I said that I would help him.
It's easy to make friends, but hard to get rid of them.
I need to get another few hours of sleep.

Tom insisted on doing it.
You certainly have a lot of questions.
Where is Tom going?
I'd better get to bed soon.
All of us went except for him.
Show me how to do it.
I think I can.
Tom is wearing a hearing aid.
I'd like one more blanket.
It was careless of her to forget it.
She doesn't have as much patience as you do.
I thought Tom was in Australia.
No matter where Tom goes, he has a good reputation.
I will go to the meeting.
Why didn't anyone warn me?
We have one advantage.
Mary wants to sweep the house.
Tom is wasting time.
I fed the dog.
Tom seems conceited.
He ran away with the diamond.
It's my mistake, not yours.
Why don't you have a girlfriend?
My father doesn't understand me.
I've got this little job I want you to do.
I'm pressing charges.
Tom is doing fine.
Are you sure this is what you want?
Are you American or French?
What would you do in this situation?
It's not a dream.
Both Tom and Mary work as models.
Come and help me out.
I'll hang my coat up behind the door.
They were perfect.
Aren't you going to introduce me?
The coach made us run three extra laps.
I would never feed my dog commercial dog food.
I want to see if I can find out what happened to those men.
Take this chair. It's sturdy.
If you want to get out of here alive, listen to me.
Are you unhappy?
I would like to make a phone call.
She finished ironing the clothes a few minutes ago.
A kiss without a mustache is like a bowl of soup with no salt.
You're driving me nuts.
Were you expecting something different?
Tom says he's willing to do just about anything for me.
What is it you'd like me to do?
She speaks Russian.
I like Tom.
Tom realized that what Mary said wasn't true.
You look nervous.
You look as healthy as ever.
Have you noticed anything out of the ordinary?
Tom asked Mary why she was so late.
He broke my heart.
I'm used to waiting.
I had nowhere to hide.
My wish is to go to Switzerland.
Tell me a true story.
In Canada, there are many areas where it is illegal to log trees.
Tom is a gardener.
Tom urged Mary to be more careful.
The room will be painted tomorrow.
What do you think the best way to do it is?
He was weak from the loss of blood.
This is kind of sudden, isn't it?
He doesn't want you to know.
Tom wanted to explain, but Mary wouldn't let him.
Recently, I moved to a new apartment.
Tom couldn't believe it.
It didn't surprise me at all that Tom got arrested from drunken driving.
Don't worry. Tom won't let us down.
I read the book from cover to cover.
Tom refused to give me what I asked for.
I know an English language instructor who comes from Canada.
How much is the handling charge?
The stories in the book are written for her.
I have nothing to complain about.
Don't cry.
The important thing is that you're alive.
It's well past Tom's bedtime.
Tom left the house to his son.
Sometimes it's necessary to tell the truth.
I bought a pair of gloves.
My family just moved here from Boston.
These cars are big.
There is no point in studying if you are feeling tired.
He is expected to come home soon.
Tom decided to be a firefighter.
She sang to her heart's content.
I know you're busy, too.
Tom has to listen to us.
This packaging is hard to remove.
Would you like me to help you with your luggage?
Who is that young woman?
Let's go to Boston together.
He belittles others to make himself feel important.
Look, it's snowing!
I don't get the connection.
Tom's decision to get married surprised his family.
Without your assistance, I would have failed.
This dictionary is superior to that one.
The ship was flying the American flag.
The reasons are as follows.
You can't ride a horse.
We stayed at home because it was raining.
I was born in October.
He put the book on the table.
I would think that Tom would appreciate your help.
Are you waiting for me to do it?
Tom is going to be here in fifteen minutes.
Even if you aren't hungry, you should eat something. Otherwise you won't last until lunch time.
I paid for it in euros.
Tom doesn't like Mary, but I like her.
We had to put off the meeting because of the storm.
It's time to quit.
He was summoned to appear in court.
He may be the very man that I need.
Tom didn't even have the decency to admit he was wrong.
This is a very complex issue.
Tom plays the xylophone.
Where do I go from here?
How can we achieve a balance between work and personal life?
Keep next Sunday free.
Tom hid his weapons.
Mary thought she could change Tom.
When can I visit you?
He has a cold now.
You remind me of your mother.
I was waiting for a taxi.
You ought to listen to your mother.
I'd like to sail around the world.
The confused travelers realized they were headed toward the wrong town.
I think I might need to go home early.
Everybody started cheering.
You know why we're here.
Silicon is a semiconductor.
Tom, what's wrong with you tonight?
I know why you're doing this.
He always treats me like a child.
Some things are better not said.
Tom and Mary built a sand castle on the beach.
Joking aside, what are you trying to say?
We're scared it'll happen again.
I've asked everybody.
Tom told me he wanted to quit his job.
I escaped death.
As the sun rises, the morning mist gradually fades away.
My mom was very strict, too.
I graduated from Kyoto University.
Can you repair these shoes?
She can never keep a secret.
I think I've made myself clear.
She came out on top.
Tom ate the apple that Mary had left on the dining room table.
How long was Tom in the water?
Tom has a daughter about your age.
They need daily care.
I thanked Tom for the present.
I use it.
Tom bought the same camera that Mary has.
Tom hasn't made much progress.
I'm afraid that's not good enough.
Have you already read this book?
We're waiting for the shop to open.
He didn't keep his appointment.
How long have you lived here?
When are you coming back home?
I thought Tom was in danger.
I couldn't help myself.
There's someone else I want to see.
Have you measured it?
I called Tom.
I found it easy to answer the question.
Better late than never.
I wrote Mary a letter.
Tom wants to change the world.
I want you to stay here until I come back.
He asked me for my phone number.
I only just met Tom.
Thank you for adding me to your contacts.
I think that honesty is the best policy.
Tom's sleeping.
Would you like another piece of cake?
I want your answer by the end of the day.
It was very hot this afternoon.
That's terrifying.
We'll just do what we originally planned.
Mary never leaves her house without first putting on makeup.
It's their right.
They're just students.
Breathe in deeply.
Tom was caught stealing money from the cash register.
Tom is sweeping his room.
The picnic was held in the gym on account of the rain.
He looked like a rich man.
Are you Chinese or Japanese?
I have no idea what you mean.
How does Tom know that?
Do you know anything?
He works at a bank.
Write at least 250 words.
You can keep it if you want.
The family fortune has increased a great deal.
Tom opened his present.
It moved closer and closer.
They walked upstairs.
Tom asked Mary if she could make him a sandwich.
What's your major?
Don't be too long.
It looks like I got here too early.
You need a joystick.
It's really very annoying.
Come on, hurry up.
Have you ever been to Disneyland?
Generally speaking, savings are increasing.
I wonder what I'll do once I get home.
I wonder why Tom hit Mary.
My house doesn't have an air conditioner.
He has Alzheimer's.
It took me a while to understand what she was trying to say.
You had better take a bath to get warm.
It took him three years to write the novel.
Do you have a quiet place where you can do your homework?
I will go on ahead.
The smell of the roses filled the whole room.
Two years ago Tom and Mary split up, but recently they got together again.
This beach is a popular tourist spot.
We mustn't let this news get out.
We must find it.
I felt that I should help her.
We have very little time, so listen carefully.
I love you more than anything.
I don't like pizza anymore.
We have the same problem.
I study French.
Imagine yourself having already accomplished that.
He just shrugged his shoulders.
Fish is expensive.
She's the girl of my dreams.
It has never snowed on the island.
We're not leaving without you.
How do you like my new suit?
Tom left the room without saying a word to anyone.
What're you doing there?
I am sending the invoice by fax.
Dinner's almost ready.
You'll feel better after a bath.
I don't know what to say about that.
Luckily, I have a mother who loves me.
What do you do here?
Tom sat watching TV.
I cannot afford to buy such a thing.
Let's try!
What would you like for breakfast?
What time do you start boarding?
Something incredible happened.
Who's that cute guy I saw you with yesterday?
I must tell you something.
Feel free to stay.
Tom told me that I should spend more time with my family.
I'm sure they'll win.
The water turned to ice.
This carpet is beautiful.
She is always forgetting my phone number.
It's a direct flight from Tokyo to London.
We want to see it.
How are you holding up?
She was seen at a restaurant with her lover.
You can't let Tom get away with that.
He appeared hungry.
She always gets her own way.
When you yawn, cover your mouth with your hand.
You should wash your hair.
Who did you go there with?
Tom took a tiny bite out of Mary's donut.
Tom and I were really worried about you.
I know you like to travel, Tom.
Waiting is just a waste of time.
Tom went in Mary's place.
Why are you so obsessed with cars?
This telephone is out of order.
Tom sympathized.
I like your family.
She got into the car and drove off.
Tom is a cold-blooded murderer.
Can you really not swim?
Do Martians speak English?
I don't know when he got back from France.
She may spill the beans.
This is Tom.
The train was late because of an accident.
I took an arrow in the knee.
Do you have a match?
I've got to do this now.
I don't want to fight with Tom.
That's not advisable.
I'll have to meet you there.
Is this really all that important?
The police will put you behind bars for twenty years.
I'm glad you were right.
My sister jogs every day.
Didn't you just repair that three days ago?
Buy some milk on your way home.
She knows how to play the guitar.
What was the weather yesterday?
Why did you invite Tom to the party?
I need to see you in my office.
They abandoned the ship.
You play the piano, don't you?
Do you spend most of your time worrying about things that don't matter so much?
Tom is one of Mary's brothers.
I am afraid the loss will amount to one hundred million dollars.
He speaks French fluently.
I couldn't speak French.
She stood by him.
Let's play this game again.
Put that cigarette out.
I'll think about it.
It's not new.
I want to show Tom around town.
The world is full of interesting people.
Tom made a funny face.
How familiar are you with my case?
Tom was appalled.
Tom is better at science than anyone else in his class.
This isn't my umbrella. It's someone else's.
He is thirsty for fame.
How sure are you it's not Tom?
Please read that book.
Tom was entranced by Mary's singing.
In my opinion, French is a hard language to learn.
Tom rose to go, but Mary asked him to sit back down.
I think this is important.
Do you know how deep the water is?
He dared not jump over the brook.
Don't you want to say anything?
Tom has an uncle who is a banker.
It is too dark to play outside.
When is he coming back?
Our principal made a long speech.
There can be only one explanation for that.
How are things in Boston?
She's better at it than I am.
Tom is probably going to be able to answer your question.
It snowed all day yesterday.
The wind knocked the birdhouse out of the tree.
It's not a competition.
Tom stayed quiet.
Tom was fearless.
Can I borrow your computer?
I ate a fly by mistake.
I'm sorry if I'm bothering you.
I received a letter from her.
I think they do that on purpose.
Tom convinced his father to stop smoking.
The flowers are wilting.
Tom doesn't even understand it himself.
If you need my advice, I'd be glad to give it to you.
I helped my mother in the kitchen.
Please turn off the light before leaving the room.
I'm not here because of that.
Do as he tells you.
Early to bed and early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise.
You couldn't solve the problem, could you?
I'd like to think about it a little bit longer.
Why aren't you dancing?
We know something about it.
Tom threw something at me and I ducked.
Tom noticed that.
When I was fifteen, I got a room of my own.
Tom got caught in a traffic jam.
Now that I am well again, I want to study space science in college.
We're Facebook friends.
Do you serve any sugar-free beverages?
He painted the ceiling blue.
He is full of new ideas.
Do you play any sports?
I major in sociology.
I just ran into Tom in the dining hall.
Tom can't have done it.
I couldn't put up with his rudeness.
I have a boyfriend.
You should have refused his offer.
We still have some farm equipment that hasn't been used since my grandfather died.
I'm not a patient person.
Don't play ball in this room.
This machine generates electricity.
Ask Tom to help you.
I caught an awful cold.
How long have you been in Kushiro?
Tom closed his eyes and began to count sheep.
I'm not sure I want to see this.
Many of the states owed large amounts of money.
Be careful that the thread doesn't break.
The man charged me with being irresponsible.
Tom has this large room to himself.
I felt like crying.
I'd like to meet Tom someday.
You don't need that.
You made the same mistake again.
Tom was able to park behind the hotel.
You don't have the right.
He saw himself as the savior of the world.
Tom was surprised that Mary was still up.
I use it every day.
Did you hire Tom?
Tom will be in his office all afternoon.
Tom lost his temper and hit Mary.
We don't have that in Europe.
Tom has already left.
Tom rubbed his face.
I don't know anything about the future.
Brush your teeth after every meal.
How did you achieve that?
I don't think it's any of your business.
She came back in about thirty minutes.
When Tom looked down at the apple he was eating, he realized that he had eaten half a worm.
Can you iron this T-shirt for me, please?
There is a police car parked outside our house.
That black bird is not a blackbird.
Thank you for your explanation.
Tom was admiring my new car at the time the truck crashed into it.
I assemble car engines.
Bears like honey.
I didn't know Tom.
Mary looks absolutely stunning.
I can't give you the answer today.
You made the same mistake again.
Translating is not nearly as easy as many people might think.
I bought forty dollars' worth of gasoline today.
My car wouldn't start.
I knew it would happen.
Please freeze the fish and meat.
They remained in Tennessee.
You should work hard.
Wash your feet.
People who don't work, won't be fed.
I don't really like Tom all that much.
Tom began to eat lunch.
At this rate, the risk is high that our country's competitive position will drop even further.
Where did you get your degree?
The artist always painted alone.
Can I come in for a few minutes?
He can't take care of himself.
He is getting better.
Are you from Boston?
We never say goodbye to each other.
Your outrage is completely justified.
All is well.
The boy hid behind the door.
You never seem to get sick.
There have been a lot of complaints about your behavior.
Shall I drive you home?
Please choose one person.
He was quickly recaptured.
I'm going to Tom's house to study.
Tom and Mary went for a walk even though it was raining.
I know where you can hide.
Did Tom have a plan?
This book is selling well these days.
The game will be played rain or shine.
A mouse is running around the room.
Nobody tried to help Tom.
Tom leaned against the wall.
The consequence of a wrong translation can sometimes be catastrophic.
It's my brother's.
Tom might hear you.
What's your plan for tomorrow?
Is this your DVD?
There's a magazine in my room.
I wonder where to hang this picture that Tom gave me.
Do you have any further questions?
He is always with me.
We often tell each other stories.
I need a lawyer who can speak French.
He'll always come through.
Please change this for a blue one.
Tom doesn't know what to think.
Some of my friends are going to the movies tomorrow.
That's the reason why I couldn't attend the meeting.
What is this thing?
Guess whose middle name is Tom.
Who's quitting?
Tom is sleeping now.
I bought my sister a new hat.
The referee blew his whistle to end the match.
Why are you so hard-headed?
Just follow them.
I forgot my account number.
Do you speak Spanish?
I suddenly thought of my dead mother.
I think I've been here before.
I take my dog for a walk, rain or shine.
I like milk more than juice.
Where's my breakfast?
Watch out for Tom.
I know something Tom doesn't know.
The post office is down the street. You cannot miss it.
I see a house.
Can you ask Tom to come in?
Don't forget to call Tom.
I'm going to Boston with you.
I'd like to open an account.
Where do you want to go this summer vacation?
Do you know how to use a computer?
Speaking English is a lot of fun.
Has Tom ever asked you to help him?
I agree with you 100 percent.
Hurry up, or you will miss the train.
Tom put his clothes on.
I hate Tom's parents.
He filled the bottle with water.
I just wanted to make sure Tom was OK.
I'm all for your suggestion.
I learned it from him.
He has a perfect body.
Tom can't swim.
You're not telling me anything I haven't already heard.
She left her son a lot of money.
Where is my comb?
He told me to meet him at the restaurant.
The church bells are ringing.
Opposite the park there is a beautiful river.
Tom has a heavy German accent.
I'm sorry to have caused you such inconvenience.
How naive do you think I am?
We'll protect each other.
I've lost the key to my house.
He doesn't have enough experience.
It's our fault.
Tom called Mary to ask her whether she wanted him to buy some bread on his way home from work.
What's the matter, Tom?
Tom asked Mary about her life in Australia.
I'm sure Tom will forgive you if you explain everything to him.
Maybe you don't want to remember.
Tom is assertive.
He is a heroin addict.
Silence implies consent.
The view from this room is wonderful.
Let's start right away.
French bread is delicious.
That's ridiculous!
Tom can't sleep.
I finished writing the report.
If that happens, I'll be very glad.
What'll Tom do about it?
Tom loved Mary, you know.
You could ask Tom.
I don't have much time left.
You remember Tom and Mary, don't you?
I don't recall saying that.
Let's fly kites.
Are you currently using any medication?
I'm allergic to carrots.
I said get out.
One billion people speak English.
He doesn't earn enough money to live on.
He likes potato salad.
Where is the embassy?
The sand was warm.
Don't waste your time trying to help Tom.
Your jokes aren't funny.
He stood in front of me.
First, we have to find out where they live.
We're leaving the day after tomorrow.
My hobby is fishing.
I thought you set the alarm for 2:30.
How long does it take to walk to your house from here?
Don't try this at home.
Tom was right and Mary was wrong.
Who will look after the baby?
Do you want the rest of my sandwich?
In the morning, I write in the park.
The dog followed him wherever he went.
Our team lost all of its games.
You must go at once.
You can't force me to do this.
Mary received many gifts for her birthday.
You should go to bed early.
Hi, how're you doing?
Did you take him home?
All of the students were present.
I'm Tom's stepfather.
Do we really need it?
When you're a father, you'll understand.
You were brave.
How was your weekend?
I told Tom what Mary told me.
I left halfway through the movie.
What is your address?
Tom ate all his meals in his room.
I asked him to start at once.
Tom and his brother have very little in common.
I don't want to butt in all the time when the two of them are fighting.
He's just evil.
I know you like Tom.
It's unacceptable.
There's nobody at the door.
Have a great day.
Tom says he doesn't like living downtown.
She traveled all over the world.
Hey. I know you.
Tom didn't stand.
I thought there was a possibility that Tom was going to break the contract.
What was he doing when you saw him?
I'm pretty sure I'll get used to this eventually.
Tom found one.
I remember mentioning it once or twice.
How long do I have to wait for the next bus?
How is your last name written?
Tom raised his hand to ask a question.
Why should I apologize?
By hard work we can achieve anything.
Please stop it.
Tom is really very smart.
No one wants to volunteer.
Tom took out his cell phone so that he could take a selfie.
Are you joking?
I understand what you're trying to tell me.
You owe me an explanation.
Where did you buy this guitar?
I'm assuming you're Canadian.
If you take this medicine, you will feel better.
Tom is a man of few wants.
The dress is pure silk.
I'm coming to you.
Don't swim in the river.
Turn around.
I'd like to show this picture of Tom to you.
What'll you do this weekend?

I don't know what to do here.
Even Tom is surprised that Mary lied.

I already knew this.
All humans on Earth are descended from a common ancestor.
Tom likes maple syrup on his pancakes.

Is there an ATM nearby?
If you will not be available at the new time, please let us know.
My father takes a walk every morning.
How did you solve the problem?
I promised your mother I'd look after you.

I can't let Tom see me like this.
Tom is about my size.
He wore old shoes.
He got what he wanted against all odds.
If you need help, just ask.
He is hard to deal with.
You're unreliable.
The evening he died was stormy.
Would you like me to help you with washing the dishes?
They painted their toenails.
I think that Japanese students are very good at gathering knowledge.
You can't hurt my feelings.
We did nothing wrong. It was only a kiss.
I'm fairly certain Tom can't do that.
Tom can do just about anything.
Keep in touch.
There are some things you can't learn from books.
Tom boiled the potatoes.
May I have something to drink?
The clock stopped. It needs a new battery.

Tom and Mary will go with me.
Don't change your mind so often.
I've read a lot of books.
Can't you see I'm not interested?
I didn't catch your last name.
Tom is extremely strong.
Hit Tom.
They hugged Tom.
The theater is empty.
I'd like to improve my French.
You were in the second year of middle school last year, right?
Tom has a black eye.
How do you feel now?
It's not exactly a hot spot, it's more of a dive bar.
Exactly what does that mean?
He ran for his life.
We're not happy.
Look, if you still want to go, I won't stop you.
Do you think Tom knows what happened?
The accident destroyed all his hopes for success.
Why does she look so sad?
I know the boy standing over there.
You know this isn't fair.
Is there anything special you want to do this weekend?
Can I do it again?
What do you intend to do?
Tom baked a cake for Mary's birthday.
We need a strong person to lead our nation.
I saw her crossing the street.
Wait five minutes, please.
How long did you stay there?
It would be a good idea to try doing that.
This works every time.
Tom put on a coat.
Stay where you are.
I haven't had a chance to see the movie yet.
The committee consists of fifteen people.
Don't worry about the past.
He plays golf on weekends.
The medicine is hard to swallow.
I wonder whether or not Tom has ever considered going to a specialist.
Tom climbed up the ladder and picked an apple from the tree.
Tom caught Mary smoking a cigarette.
Look out for bees.
I began to be afraid you would never come back again.
Tell me everything you know about Tom.
Try on this sweater.
Do you mind if I ask you something?
I assumed you would come.
What country are you from?
You should've paid your bills on time.
I never said no.
Hey, you! What are you doing?
I'll change the sheets.
We haven't got much time.
The bus went past the bus stop.
We've never been to Boston.
I can't promise Tom won't be back.
Tell me where to go next.
We're going to send you to Boston to work in our office there.
She is more famous than you.
I was right about Tom.
Reptiles are cold-blooded.
If there's anything else you need, just let me know.
I almost had enough money to buy everything I needed.
They took our passports.
I know people.
Just smile and be happy.
I'm not buying your story.
Put some salt into the boiling water.
I have to hurry. My flight leaves in an hour.
He's not worthy of you.
That's not exactly what I had in mind.
Tom lumbered along like an elephant.
I thought there was somebody in the meeting room.
This food is gluten-free.
Do you have time to come tomorrow?
Tom has been generous.
Why does Tom think I'm here?
It wasn't Tom who kissed Mary.
It seems she hates you.
I didn't know what I should say to Tom.
Wait a minute. Something's not right.
Wait up.
This is my lucky day.
Write to me.
She led me on.
I wish it would stop raining.
That won't work.
He shined his shoes.
Gasoline isn't cheap anymore.
The cube root of twenty-seven is three.
Are you watching me?

Grandmother looks after the children during the day.
Tom said he doesn't know anyone in Boston.
Tom has three thousand books.
Fish, please.
You are quite a man.
Tom remained skeptical.
I'm just looking.
The cat is sleeping on the table.
I make it a rule to take a walk around the nearby pond in the evening.
One does not wear a red mini skirt to a funeral.
The cat played with the toy mouse.
I bought the car at a 10% discount.
I assume you know who Tom is.
I don't want you two talking about me.
She gave birth to twins.
I saw something strange in the sky.
I haven't seen him for years.
Tom played a few tunes on the piano.
What do you make of this?
Tell me the truth.
Tom has many cats.
Tom was unjustly accused of the crime.
She was born at six a.m. on July 17, 1990.
I can't stand being contradicted.
She was very surprised when she heard the news.
I never get tired of watching Tom and Mary play darts.
He does not care for ice cream.
I told you to stop doing that.
Hold still a moment while I fix your tie.
He's a talented writer.
The man took my arm.
Just because you're my girlfriend doesn't mean I have to agree with you.
May I sit next to you?
She gave me a nice pair of shoes.
The prince asked the little girl why she was crying.
Forget about it.
Fishing is fun.
May I go now?
This shop is a rental video shop.
He took me to the park yesterday.
My husband is a good man.
Why are you always so cynical?
Mary looks hot.
The Japanese destroyed Pearl Harbor.
I want proof.
Tom squatted down next to his dog.
I think Tom knew.
Tom's house is warm inside even on cold days.
You're the one that I was looking for.
Stop worrying and get some sleep.
I can't help you because I am busy.
Tom's handwriting isn't very good, but it's easy to read.
Why don't you guys like me?
Can you give me this one, please?
The house is small, but it's enough for us.
Why didn't you think of that before?
I'm not sure what else I can do for you.
I should've stayed in bed.
There wasn't a cloud in the sky.
I must resist.
I want you guys to wait for me.
The picnic was called off because of rain.
Tom collects antiques.
Tom didn't let Mary kiss him.
Tom was asleep when the doorbell rang.
She intended to withdraw all her savings from the bank.
He raised his hand to stop a taxi.
Tom bet me thirty dollars that I couldn't do it.
I am able to drive a car.
Tom is considered trustworthy.
I will provide you all the necessary information.
You have the advantage of a good education.
I was relieved to hear that he was alive.
No one noticed Tom.
The two brothers are very much alike.
I have no desire to do that.
Thousands of people died during the plague.
Tom quit going out with Mary because he didn't like her sense of humor.
Is this biodegradable?
Tom found a new job.
Her answer was incorrect.
Tom is a really good football player.
The castle is beautiful.
Does it rain there very often?
I'd better see him.
My name is Tom and this is Mary.
Tom is a promising young man.
The cat slowly approached the mouse.
Say it again, please.
Tom is a dwarf.
I like this love song.
Can I ask why this is so important to you?
Give it to her.
I've kept my weight down even though many of my friends have gained weight as they've grown older.
He bugged her with questions.
It's made of brass.
Tom has lost weight recently.
I need you to do something for me.
I think you'll be happy here.
He was accompanied by his aunt.
Tom has two sons. One is a doctor and the other is a lawyer.
What a beautiful house!
Tom doesn't drive.
Tom just called you a liar.
I succeeded in my first attempt.
Would you mind reading it to me?
Tom removed the splinter from Mary's finger.
There was a lot of food in the house.
Where's Tom's office?
Tom is reading a book in the library.
Tom blew out the candles.
"Are you and Tom enemies?" "No. Why would we be?"
It's acceptable.
You had better not go.
That's a minor detail.
Mary is carrying a watermelon.
You're very attentive.
You can't give Tom that.
Tom shot at Mary with a crossbow.
Nothing's been changed.
I opened the door.
The soldiers could do nothing until spring.
She was so tired that she couldn't walk.
We've been talking about you.
I want you to dance.
What'll happen to us now?
I know why you're not happy.
We don't want to create any new problems.
Tom is trying to figure out a way to do that.
I looked down.
I would like to thank my parents, Tom and Mary.
The concert came to an end at ten o'clock.
Write these words in your notebook.
Everything happens for a reason.
He thought that it would be interesting and fun.
You're braver than me.
This river becomes shallow at that point.
You can't have your own way in everything.
Could I have some water?
Would you like more coffee?
It's possible Tom didn't know about the meeting.
I grabbed the cat by the neck.
Whales feed on plankton and small fish.
What're you guys doing here?
Tom had to wait.
I want that car.
He doesn't drink.
I have no time to explain this in detail.
Read it again.
You always complain about the weather.
Tom is the one who gave me this bicycle.
Do you know when Tom's birthday is?
I don't like your taste in color.
What happened to your car?
I don't want any of my children to be lawyers.
Let go of the bottle.
Tom flexed his muscles.
How do you like Boston?
I met a young man whose name was Tom.
It's getting worse.
I'll be with Tom and Mary.
Tom may not be as hungry as you think he is.
I can't play the piano, but she can.
What do you want me to get?
She disappeared in the dark.
You're just like your father.
Japan is not what it was ten years ago.
I don't know if she will come.
The ice melted into a puddle of water.
Do you want to come?
There is a bank in front of the station.
Will you pass me the salt, please?
He occasionally visited me.
A scream broke the silence.
We'll run in the park.
To the best of my knowledge, this chemical will prevent germs from breeding.
He explained his plan both to my son and to me.
Did you carry out your plan?
I can't see any difference.
I can't figure out how this happened.
I want those back when you're done.
We didn't actually see the accident.
I'm planning to buy a mobile phone tomorrow.
I found the key in Tom's jacket pocket.
Tom didn't want Mary to see him in handcuffs.
I said I'll get it.
Even though he was poor, he was happy.
Where does he want to go?
Schools were built.
He lives within his means.
I often travel.
The vampire movie filled them with terror.
Quit stalling.
All three of you need to do that.
I hope he isn't ill.
Let me pay.
How often do you go shopping?
Tom and Mary were always fighting when they were younger.
I arrived on the night he left.
I can neither confirm or deny that report.
She bought a book at the shop.
These aren't yours, are they?
The child offered a flower to the visitor.
I never hear anything.
You may take photos outside this museum, but not inside.
We found out that what he said wasn't true.
Tom is a pirate.
Tom will come with me.
Don't eat that if you think it smells funny.
Were you expecting something different to happen?
The sky grew darker and darker, and the wind blew harder and harder.
I agree to your plan.
What kind of books do you like?
Let me do it.
I hope no one saw you come in here.
The fugitive crossed the river.
That's what I intend to do.
I'm trying to imagine that.
You're free to go.
That's easy to say, but it's not easy to do.
Tom doesn't know when it'll happen, but he's pretty sure that it will happen.
I'm saving up so that I can go to Australia.
My new laptop is thinner and lighter than my old one.
We're under attack.
Promise me you won't go.
This book was very interesting.
I told Tom to study harder.
He lives outside the city.
The bathroom window is open.
How many times a week do you take a bath?
You like her, don't you?
She looked after her sister, who was in bed with a bad cold.
What are you going to do with those?
Tom wasn't at the meeting.
They will tear down the old building in two days.
We have to keep trying until we find a method that works.
Hi, my name is Pekka. What is your name?
Turn on the light, please.
Tom wrote a letter to Santa.
I bet you think I'm just writing that to impress you.
I paid 2,000 yen for the parcel to be sent by air.
Please raise your hand before you speak.
Without humility, courage is a dangerous game.
Tom played a sad song on the piano.
Does the bus stop here?
She slowly closed her eyes.
You're so sweet.
Let's try to reason with them.
Tom said you were busy.
Had she been a friend of mine, I would have advised her not to do that.
This bike is like the one I've got.
Now I recognize you.
Smoke could be seen pouring out of the window.
I wish I could take back all those terrible things I said about you last night.
Everyone who worked on that project became a millionaire.
I saw how you saved Tom's life.
It is never too late to learn.
My home is my castle.
What do you think of my new haircut?
This looks good.
Thank you so much for coming by.
I never wanted to leave Boston.
He is not a friend, but an acquaintance.
Mary shaved her legs.
Tom bought something for Mary.
"Whose boots are these?" "They are Lidya's."
Tom married a much younger woman.
Why don't you believe me?
I know none of them.
This sweater costs more than fifty dollars.
What's the next station?
Persons under age are prohibited from smoking.
Are you aware of how much she loves you?
He'll answer your letter soon.
I knew your brother.
We helped each other.
Where can I find an ATM?
She goes to a school for the deaf.
Tom sings tenor.
They spoke briefly.
Everybody loves Tom.
I'm far from happy about this situation.
Tom drives a sports car, doesn't he?
He was persuaded to change his mind.
He will come soon.
The children were sliding on the ice.
I'm losing.
Please shut the door.
Do you know when she will come?
I need a new wardrobe.
Then we went to the theater.
Texting while driving is very dangerous.
Tom hardly ever talks about his work.
He sneaked around to the back door.
Don't let anybody see you.
No one wanted to insult these men.
He pressed down on the suitcase to close it.
He is afraid of becoming sick.
I wish I lived in Boston.
Tom got better.
Tom is expected to make a full recovery.
We go there often.
Last week I was at the beach, but today I'm home.
It's said that he knows the secret.
If you're not quiet, I'm going to ask you to leave.
I can't hear it.
Who is this boy?
Here is your change.
We played cards after dinner.
I can assure you we'll never make that mistake again.
Tom is baffled.
Tom said that he and Mary would probably be a little late.
As is often the case, he eats while reading a newspaper.
I want to know why you lied.
I bought an electric car.
The water flows under the bridge.
Tom asked me why I didn't live in Boston anymore.
I am able to swim across the river.
You know Tom is telling the truth.
I'm going to grow wheat there.
I wish I were as smart as you are.
Why do we sneeze?
I couldn't have done it without you.
This is too small.
I just don't feel safe here anymore.
Everything in Tom's house was covered with dust.
Give me a drink.
Tom managed a small bar near Boston for quite a few years.
Tom said he hated this book.
Tom had other things he wanted to be doing.
They were told to play in the nearby park.
Lunch is on.
What's the length of this bridge?
Tom couldn't remember what they'd been talking about.
How was the math test?
Why do you put up with that?
Tom's team suffered a crushing defeat.
I hid myself under the bed.
Tom whispered something to Mary.
Tom and Mary are like family.
I also like apples.
I'm sorry I stepped on your foot.
We're perfectly safe here.
I will give him the book tomorrow.
Who were you dreaming about?
Has anyone ever told you that you have beautiful eyes?
I wonder what Tom and Mary are up to.
He's completely crazy.
Are you independent?
Tom is taking care of the kids.
Can you help me find my keys?
You've both been very helpful.
If you look, you'll notice that he's turning left.
I hope that no one saw you coming in here.
You need to take your shoes off before entering the room.
You did it again.
This is my office.
Tom is a thief.
In the end, he landed in jail.
Tom glanced away.
I'm a student in a university.
He did it while he was drunk.
You're wounded.
We'll work tomorrow.
I will be sixteen in May.
Those are from Tom, aren't they?
The pigeon has flown away.
He asked after you.
Have you ever seen a car accident?
Driving a truck isn't easy.
I got up early enough to catch the first train.
I'm not a crook.
All of my relatives are taller than me.
That's a lot to ask.
She wants to hug him.
Does that mean I'm in trouble?
Do you have any complaints?
I love karaoke, but I'm not much of a singer.
My grandfather was killed in World War II.
I can't find it. Are you sure it's here?
Tom didn't tell Mary to do that.
Break it down.
We drank all night.
Tom is a drummer.
Tom had never had that problem before.
Tom doesn't look so busy, does he?
That's one of my New Year's resolutions.
You must believe me.
The food is cold.
No one's in there.
Don't overexert yourself.
They made fun of Mary.
Warm and humid weather increases the number of crimes.
He stuck out his tongue at his teacher.
I couldn't get it.
The order came too late.
Why did you quit your job?
I'm the only one who stayed awake all night.
If he wants to succeed at all, he must work harder.
Tom began to feel hungry.
The flowers cheered her up.
How do I get one?
Tom built a ship inside a bottle.
He married my cousin.
I've got to go back and check.
He has been to France three times.
Let's split.
Tom picked up one of the magazines.
She looks nice and healthy.
I'm just lucky.
I don't need anyone's help.
I haven't yet finished my homework.
My birthday's not for another month.
Tom always worries about his daughter.
We'll notify Tom.
The experiment failed.
A lot of English words are derived from Latin.
Tell him that I want to see the telegram that he sent.
I am a man who can't stand being alone.
The nail tore his jacket.
Tom was detained as a suspect.
Tom is doing great in school.
What day are you usually free?
The doctors are still trying to save Tom.
Tom was perplexed.
I'm going to stop Tom.
The very thought of eating snails makes me feel sick.
We were really tight.
Have you been to Hokkaido?
I need some time to myself.
Whose camera is this?
The party's over.
Where do you buy your clothes?
I think that Tom likes Mary.
How is life treating you?
Do you translate lyrics?
I was very hungry.
He's Austrian.
Are you studying English?
I should have stayed out of it.
I don't expect you to start now.
You're still taller than me.
Pasta heated up again is never any good.
No one understands me either.
I'm the one who should apologize.
I spent the whole evening reading the poetry of Kenji Miyazawa.
Don't bury your head in the sand.
Tom said he only needed a few more minutes.
By the year 2020, the population of our city will have doubled.
Tom said that's what he wants to do.
I'm going to have a heavy day.
Do you think it means something?
You're not going to walk, are you?
There are some eggs in the box.
Scientists will come up with new methods of increasing the world's food supply.
I want to show you something.
It's great to be here.
Everyone in the office knew about Tom's problems.
Stop staring at me like that.
Did you enjoy the concert?
It gets on my nerves.
You remind me of your father.
The circus will come to town tomorrow.
Tom doesn't want to ever leave Australia.
You don't have to hide your feelings.
Tom couldn't shake the feeling that something horrible was about to happen.
You have some explaining to do.
I'm going to invest money in this business.
Whenever I meet her, she smiles at me.
You can't let the dog out of the yard.
They'll look after me.
What kind of question is that? Do you really expect me to answer that?
It will be finished in a day or two.
Tom is still downstairs.
I'd like a city map.
Tom was terrific.
Tom is sure to accomplish whatever he sets out to do.
Don't leave!
I didn't have to thank Tom, but I did.
I'll see you again.
The cherry trees are in full bloom.
Tom and Mary both lay down in the grass, exhausted.
America is very big.
That's not a very funny story.
What a pretty girl!
I should've chosen a shorter username.
Tom is a vet.
I don't have to think about it.

I can't eat fruit in the morning.
I told Tom I'd pick him up after school.
The house was struck by lightning yesterday.
The group disbanded.
She refused his offer.
I am thinking about my children.
Tom had a cigar in his mouth.
Tom has his kid with him.
Let's presume you're right.
How far is it to the airport?
Get started.
Why didn't the police notify us?
In many countries, whenever a group of people from various language backgrounds get together, English is usually the language that is spoken.
Tom is currently working on that problem.
We have no alternatives.
Do you know his name?
Were your mother and father home?
Tom and Mary have everything they need.
These days I'm very busy.
You can't really expect to get better at French if you don't study.

I have nothing to wear.
You look smashing.
Either Tom is lying or Mary is lying.

You aren't going to do that, are you?
Tom finished the work by himself.
Don't be a coward.
Tom's parents were both teachers.
The meeting took place yesterday.
Is your dog mean?
The ceremony was impressive.
The bridge is under construction.
Spring will be here soon.
She went to see him the other day.
As soon as I find it, I'll bring it over to your place.
I know exactly where I am.
What in the world got into you?
The hunter shot a fox.
Where's Tom now?
Tom was attracted to Mary.
Do you have enough time?
He is clever enough to solve the problem.
I only read the first four chapters.
I haven't lied to you.
I should be at school.
Maybe you'll succeed.
The conference is going to end today.
We're grateful for your assistance.
It's already eleven o'clock. I must be leaving now.
I think this will work.
My mother is always busy.
To my relief, he came home safe and sound.
They are not a well-matched couple.
Don't leave it up to chance.
Mom and Dad gave me a bicycle.
It is not a matter to laugh about.
This house is famous.
Tom and Mary both have very few friends.
We need additional staff.
Guess what he told me.
What do they do?
Please knock before entering.
Let's study French.
We already knew that.
Don't miss the bus.
She embroidered her initials on a white handkerchief.
Tom dumped me.
Don't let Tom near my kids.
Would you like cookies with your tea?
Show me the money.
I am not the person I used to be.
He was absent from school for a week.
Is it Tuesday already?
How long did you stay in Boston?
It's a custom to have turkey at Thanksgiving.
I hope it was worth it.

Thank you for baking this delicious cake.
Thank you for coming with me.
Give me another example.
I am single.
Have you noticed anything unusual?
I never should've hired Tom.
It'll be good.
She harbored the deserter.
The skin is the largest organ of the body.
The day is almost over.
That was not my question.
Tom sat down on the bed.
Tom looked at it suspiciously.
Look at what you've done.
You are important.
I'm the one responsible for the accident.
I know you're not like that.
You can rest.
One of the greatest secrets of happiness is moderating your wishes and loving what you already have.
A week from today, I'll be in England.
It'll be fun to visit Boston.
Tom wants to follow in his father's footsteps.
I don't know if he knows it.
The waste of time and money is incredible.
Did you behave today?

I'll be as quiet as a mouse.
Do you need our help?
Do you remember who I am?

They have many students.
She is the messenger.
Could you lend me three thousand dollars?
You should try a little harder.

It doesn't matter to me whether or not I make money doing this.
They blame Tom for everything.
Tom carried the chairs to the next room.

How about going for a swim?
I don't understand what you mean.
Today was a beautiful day.
We've got nothing in common.

Who intervened?
He made up his mind quickly.

I'm not at all scared.
This was too difficult a problem for her to solve.
The stars come out at night.
She came to see us yesterday.
She waved goodbye to me.
It took me a couple of hours to solve this problem.
I wish my problems would all go away.
I'd like to know why you did it.
Tom was responsible for it.
The secretary was dismissed.
Let's get some pictures.
It'll break.
That's the true reason.
He was kept waiting for a long time.
Please go to school.
This car looks like mine.
Is Tom there alone?
He believed that the earth was round.
Tom says it's your turn to take out the garbage.
I don't want Tom to lose his job.
I'm glad you noticed.
Don't leave the bicycle in the rain.
Do you prefer tea or coffee?
You lost, didn't you?
I didn't expect his behavior to descend to such a disagreeable level.
Welcome to my home.
Feel free to say no.
I want my whole family to be proud of me.
Your thirty minutes are almost up.
I was about to go to bed when he called me up.
Tom came up to me after class and asked me a few questions.
She kicked the door.
I'm allergic to corn.
What do you think about global warming?

Tom is an only child.
I heard the good news.
We used to play in the park.
Count from one to ten.
He's young, but he's very intelligent.

People who go to bed early and get up early live a long time.
That doesn't bother me at all.
Tom has been following me around.
The dress was trimmed with lace.
Come and look at what I found.
Not all those students are present.
I have one.
Do you have a minute?
When did Tom graduate?
Is there anyone who can answer?
Put your reading glasses on.
I can barely remember what my grandfather looked like.
He set out for Tokyo this morning.
What an unexpected pleasure!
It's been almost three weeks since I got back to Boston.
Fill out this registration card, please.
Put it on.
This clock is accurate.
I love these gadgets.
Tom just wanted to get rid of me.
I thought you'd wear something like that.
Tom soon fell asleep.
You could ask Tom.
It's rare to meet nice people like you.
I heard explosions.
Do you know Tom Jackson?
Please explain the rules of soccer to me.
No one has failed.
I wish I could remember his name.
I thought Tom had already tried to do that.
She came close to drowning.
Keep up the good work.
Do you understand French?
You can't live like that anymore.
I'm really sorry.
I usually get what I want.
He will advise you on that matter.
I have to go see Tom.
Just check it.
It wasn't Tom who lit the campfire.
I know you're talented.
Are you able to speak Mandarin?
It's almost like magic.
Tom remained motionless on the floor.
Tom didn't remember where he'd parked his car.

There were a fair number of people in the hall.
I'll see you at home.
When is your next train for Boston?
There are no tables in the room.
I don't want to go if you don't go with me.
You guys love each other, right?
She witnessed him being killed.
How could that have happened without anyone noticing?
Tom has braces.
The dog is sleeping in the car.
Fully booked for the night, the hotel had to turn away some late guests.
She sat next him with her eyes closed.
This table is just as large as ours.
She was not provided for in his will.
I can't tell you how to pronounce the word.
You gave me the wrong change.
This is highly inefficient.
Which do you like better, tea or coffee?
Don't lose hope.
That wasn't funny.
Tom agrees.
Tom is three years younger than I am.
You never answered the question.
Tom can't accept your gift.
Hold this.
Tom goes to school.
If you do that kind of thing, it's not fair to her.
I want you to go there with Tom.
What's your favorite Christmas movie?
She was found guilty.
He kissed her again.
After running up the hill, I was completely out of breath.
I just never seemed to fit in there.
Why didn't you tell me that?
It's possible Tom doesn't have a driver's license.
There is some truth in that.
Tom hardly ever laughs.
My wife isn't beautiful. Yours is.
I've always believed that.
What should we do first?
I thought you were going out with Tom.
Each time I see this picture, I remember my father.
Don't leave your glasses on the table.
The organization furnished the refugees with food.
I am taking French next year.
Have you already had breakfast?
I've got to find it.
It's a slippery slope.
Can you really predict the future?
She is old.
It's a pity you can't come.
Just follow Tom.
I'm against it.
Even if I had wished to stop, I couldn't.
You must not go out today.
Here is your bag.
Turn it off.
Are you a policeman?
The whale is a very large mammal which lives in the sea.
Tom came to see Mary.
He wants the camera badly.
Scores of people died in the epidemic.
You can't tell Tom what really happened.
I was the one who said we should wait.
"Would you like a drink?" "I've already got one."
I have relatives in Boston.
I'm very grateful for your help.
There was a man sitting in the sun.
I was too astonished to speak.
Is this to eat here, or to go?
I should clean the room.
This time you won't be alone.
This spoils all my plans.
Hey, Tom, can I ask you something?
Tom returned the keys to Mary.
How did Tom get you to help him clean the garage?
We're not from around here.
I'll be glad to.
How often do you edit your profile?
She is a native speaker of French.
You have to show me what to do.
I can't see why you don't want to help us.
Tom was the first one to get here today.
Does she come from the agency that sent the last temporary I had?
I won't be long.
This is the only possible time for doing that.
We agreed that there was no other alternative.
I'm not going to read it.
That's about it.
You sprained your ankle.
It might snow this evening.
What's your favorite Disney movie?
You're a wonderful woman.
It was too easy.
I hoped to have finished it by this week.
I have two dogs and I try to feed them each the same amount of food.
I did what I was told.
See you.
Tom could've said something.
Do you want to try it?
Write these words in your notebook.
Can you order it for me?
I'm sure you're sleepy.
Which do you prefer, spring or autumn?
She focused on her work.
I think he won't come.
When he saw me, he ran away.
Tom is wearing a new pair of shoes.
Her garden is a work of art.
"A Happy New Year!" "I wish you the same!"
Add more water to it.
I even wrote a speech just in case I was asked to give one.
He does not have to do this.
It's probably just the wind.
This is completely unacceptable.
Tom won the pumpkin-carving contest.
He was blue from the cold.
Go wash your hands.
What do you want to happen?
How many books can I take out at one time?
I don't care how poor you are.
Tell me what I want to know.
You have to respect the old.
Just make sure you don't forget to give this to Tom.
Tom doubted that Mary would keep her promise.
How old do you think Tom is?
You'll get over it.
Tom isn't getting one.
Would you like big bills or small bills?
Tom was sensitive.
We're so happy for you.
We're human.
Have you ever plucked a chicken?
You don't need to reinvent the wheel.
Do you think you're better than me?
You aren't really a millionaire, are you?
The day after tomorrow is Tom's birthday.
We have to figure out a way to keep Tom from seeing Mary.
Why is this?
This is for you.
They are the ones who want to go.
Everyone's looking at Tom.
I may be able to help you.
Do you study French every day?
He's your friend.
Tom walked down the hall alone.
Keep to the right.
Rain, rain, go away. Come again another day.
He left without saying anything.
Tom and Mary weren't listening to music.
We're very grateful.
I came looking for you.
The old lady climbed the stairs with difficulty.
I'm going to be there.
It is none of your business.
I'm too busy to help you right now.
I am not like you.
You know that's a lie.
Tom stopped breathing.
The soldier acted bravely.
Because of you, I'm having problems with my blood pressure.
She put on an air of innocence.
She is a very shy girl.
Tom is cooking.
What Tom saw changed his life.
It is essentially a question of time.
Where the treasure is hidden is still a mystery.
The mic is yours.
I thought you cared about Tom.
Have you ever been arrested?
Have Tom do that.
You aren't listening to what I'm saying.
I'll be going.
I'll tell you right now that Tom won't know the answer.
She woke up.
Both Tom and Mary cut themselves on some broken glass.
It's easier to learn a new language when you are young.
The world has become poorer.
Are you feeling sick?
The company has sent several representatives to discuss the matter.
I like potato salad.
Do you like to live in the country?
What's your job?
I have already finished dinner.
It's hit or miss.
Tom is responsible for this accident.
I'll be back later today.
Are you going to ask Tom?
There's something wrong with this machine.
That company is managed by my older brother.
Could I have the bill, please?
We have plenty of time.
I love to read books.
You might at least say "thank you."
Don't bother me.
You can keep this tape until tomorrow.
Ammonia is often found in cleaning products.
Tom nodded.
Here is my baggage.
Not every untrue statement is a lie.
Will you make coffee for me?
He wants me to help him.
This check is payable to the bearer.
You don't get enough exercise.
There's a party after work.
Tom got into the driver's seat and drove off.
Did you hear the bell?
You owe me $1,000.
I'm not thinking about it.
I really wish Tom would behave himself.
I don't like those people.
Algebra is a branch of mathematics.
Tom always goes to the supermarket where Mary works.
I'm not even sure if this is my key.
The traffic crept along at a snail's pace.
After hearing the tragic news, he went outside to be alone.
Tom was promoted to foreman.
Be kind to old people.
Someone wants to meet you.
Baseball is an interesting sport.
If you cannot work out the problem, you had better try a different method.
Tom is shallow.
My uncle, who lives in Osaka, visited us yesterday.
He pretends to be deaf.
Is that the picture you took of Tom yesterday?
I have your diary.
That is not your knife.
Is Tom coming to pick you up?
I'll have no choice.
Tom is a tall man.
Are you serious?
Tom is responsible for this accident.
Call home!
Tom doesn't appear to be nervous.
Can we hurry this up?
Her beauty will fade in time.
Tom knew that I was sad.
You don't have the guts.
It's a unique situation.
Does Tom enjoy it?
Does Tom have to do that?
How is Tom these days?
I think your answer is correct.
May I help you?
Where's my tip?
Take this medicine, and you'll feel better.
He was framed on a murder charge.
Tom will be absent today because he has a cold.
I thought you missed your flight.
I know you like me.
You ought to find nice shoes here.
I don't remember anything about it.
We have only a slender chance of success.
The worst-case scenario is that Tom will lose his job and won't be able to keep up his mortgage payments.
Is that supposed to frighten me?
Don't be noisy in this room.
You live too far away.
Tom is merciful.
He gave up.
I'm going to write Tom a letter.
I should've apologized right away.
Tom has a sore throat.
He's head over heels in love with Mary.
What vile behavior!
I need to sit down.
I can't work at all with all these useless calls coming in.
Both of them are very cute.
Do people ever accuse you of being conceited?
I ran downstairs.
I'm not going to lose.
I've located Tom.
Be fair.
I'll foot the bill.
You always lie to me.
Does Tom know French?
Tom is a con man.
Aren't you working today?
It's good for business.
The game got more and more exciting.
I'll study your report.
How well did you know Tom?
Even if I knew, I couldn't tell you.
It is doubtful if we can get the engine working.
The old doctor gave individual attention to each patient.
Mary lost her favorite pen.
You said you had important news.
Perhaps I was too harsh on Tom.
I'll get you back home.
My tastes differ greatly from yours.
The more time you spend talking about what you do, the less time you have to do it.
It's secret.
Tom promised me that he'd be careful.
Don't ride that horse. He'll throw you.
You have an alternative.
I'll stay here until you return.
This is a good car.
It was a huge success.
How many cups of tea do you drink a day?
This is about all I can put up with.
Tom is hiding from Mary.
I am looking forward to seeing you again soon.
It's a complicated question to answer.
Tom's condition worsened.
If necessary, I'll come at nine tomorrow.
Tom noticed a couple of changes.
Is Monday OK?
Turn the car around.
The murderer was executed.
A lot of wild animals died for lack of food.
He is a spoiled child.
He was kind enough to take me to the hospital.
All the neighbors united to clean up the park.
Get away!
Tom and Mary have been too busy fighting to notice how much they actually like each other.
Tom wants to see that.
Her fears gradually quietened down.
Tom is a responsible driver.
I knew the risk.
The water is shallow at this point.
Hey, you look great.
Everyone likes her.
What does Tom want you to do?
The gentleman is a very famous pianist.
Do you have any cough medicine?
I won't practice today.
That's not what I'm here for.
Do you like black cats?
We need at least eight hours of sleep each day.
Are you hiding something from me?
Tom taught me how to make a campfire.
Why don't you have a look?
My brother advised me to stop smoking.
You have many enemies.
I lack confidence.
I'm glad you were there.
What do you think he meant by that?
She suggested that I give it to him right away.
Tom needs at least nine hours of sleep every night or he can't function.
Mary knows that Tom isn't her real father.
The doctor said it'll be necessary to operate.
Tom had the whole place to himself.
Tom is banned from entering this building.
Tom didn't have the heart to tell Mary the truth.
He looks like a good boy.
Who's that cute girl I saw you with at the mall?
The world's largest zoo is in Berlin, Germany.
Are you planning on buying a car?
You're always busy.
Tom contributed a lot of money to charity.
I wish Tom would leave me alone.
Tom's house is within walking distance of the nearest train station.
Write me.
Tom knows more than he's letting on.
I can speak French.
This coffee is too hot for me to drink.
Tell me about your plan.
Can I ask you something very personal?
I don't know what that thing is.
She took the trouble to find a home for them.
Tom glared at Mary with hatred and disgust.
I should've known Tom was behind this.
Tom is a very good teacher.
Tom began crying.
Believe whatever you wish.
Tom got up at 6:30 as usual.
Democracy originated in Ancient Greece.
Concerning this matter, I'm the one to blame.
Have you ever heard Tom speak French?
I've heard some good things about you.
What do you think of my theory?
I'm not sure right now.
We've only been dating for a month.
Tom intends to change that.
The world is a crazy place.
Tom doesn't think that Mary was the one who did that.
Tom stepped closer to Mary.
Tom is my youngest son's oldest son.
Can we talk in private?
I hope you're happy, too.
This bus will take you to the airport.
He was put up for adoption.
Finally, I finished a painting.
Tom has told us everything we need to know.
Have you decided on a name yet for the baby?
The man must be insane.
I rushed upstairs.
Please write down what I am going to say.
It's not safe here.
How do I know you're not an imposter?
We just want to have a few questions answered.
I'll burn the midnight oil tonight.
He is also very famous in Japan.
Why should I apologize to you?
May I kiss you?
Tom's phone can take pictures.
His car fell into the lake.
I will grant that you are right on this point.
She has a rose in her hand.
Tom has endured a lot.
The room was dimly lit.
Have you eaten yet?
Almost all Japanese boys like to play baseball.
Are all the passengers aboard?
Let's do only one thing at a time.
Tom is a very rich person.
I don't like many of the people I work with.
Whoever guesses the number wins.
I missed the last train last Friday.
Could you make time for me?
Perhaps it's time you told Tom about your accident.
Let me see that.
I'm supposed to be working this afternoon.
"Why didn't you come?" "I had no choice."
Don't call me anymore.
Ask Tom if he can do that.
Tom and I both want you to be happy.
I figured you should know.
Have you ever been to the Black Sea?
I'm sure you're not half as glad as I am.
They've increased the salaries.
We don't need a ladder.
Answer in English.
He was advanced to the rank of general.
Tom had nothing to do with what happened here.
I gave three pencils to each of them.
Unfortunately, that's true.
Is she nice?
My train leaves at six o'clock and arrives there at ten o'clock.
He can't stop us.
What was Tom wearing when he died?
Here's your change.
I have to go ask Tom.
I didn't leave the door open.
The situation is complicated.
It was a resounding success.
Tom says he's in love with Mary.
It's nothing you need to worry about.
I'm worried about what'll happen if Tom comes.
Tom's mind couldn't be changed.
She wrote me a long letter.
She deliberately exposed him to danger.

I feel like eating something sweet.
I'll go out after having dinner.
Don't leave them alone.
Tell Tom about it.
Mary fluctuates between having an exaggerated sense of her own importance and an inferiority complex.
Have both of you already eaten?
The roads are jammed with cars.
The twins look so much alike it's next to impossible to distinguish one from the other.
I'm a prisoner.
"How's the world treating you, Tom?" "Pretty good."
We all mourned for the people killed in the accident.
You always said you wanted to become a scientist. Why didn't you?
Don't be so pessimistic.
Do you know Tom personally?
After slapping Tom, Mary ran out of the room.
Don't fool yourself. He doesn't love you.
I just spent an hour talking to Tom.
Tom couldn't keep lying to Mary. He felt he just had to tell her the truth.
I'll come home.
Give him my regards.
Tom has a younger sister named Mary.
I'll phone you as soon as I get to the airport.
Tom slammed the door in my face.
Tom went to the park by himself.
What you say is right.
Was that intended as a joke?
Please take me to the station.
You're back early.
Tom has a secret.
I think he's an honest man.
I'll ask Tom tomorrow.
The box is light enough for a child to carry.
Tom helps anybody that asks him.
I'm sure you'll think of something.
Have you had breakfast yet?
The princess couldn't help laughing at him.
Where do you want me?
We don't want to scare the children away.
You can always sleep on my couch.
Can you fix my computer?
Tom didn't think what Mary was wearing was appropriate for the occasion.
He asked me whether she was coming.
I heard someone screaming my name.
There were two women on board.
Start running.
It's not enough.
I ran as fast as I could, but I missed the train.
I think it would be fun.
That's your funeral.
It was a divine intervention.
Tom was crafty.

This is surprising.
I will try to do my best.
What's wrong with your dog?
Tom is not as spry as he used to be.
Tom went into Mary's office.
We went to the café that I told you about.
There's nothing I'd like more than to spend the afternoon with you.
There are a lot of people who can't do that.
Let me know if you need anything.
Mary is folding the laundry.
Why don't you have a seat?
Have you finished reading the book I lent you last week?
Please wake me up at six tomorrow morning.
I have insurance.
We're the same age.
I was so afraid that no one would ask me to dance.

Have you ever traveled by air?
Please take another one.

I want you to be happy.
Tom has a car.
The value of a good education cannot be measured in terms of money.
Don't talk so loud.
Tom asked me if I was happy and I said I was.
I wish you could stay the night.
I'm still not sure what you mean by that.
Tom is very good at sports, but not very good at school.
The young man burst into laughter.
Both of the children won a prize.
We are with you.
It's a pity you don't know how to dance.

That was very clever.

Are we leaving?
He is busy preparing for the entrance examination.
Who is sitting at the other end of the table?

Could you be so kind as to speak more slowly, please?
What is your room number?
You're the last hope for humanity.
Tom was distressed.
Tom certainly knows where Mary is.
I clicked the link, but nothing happened.
Would you like to eat something?
Tom hasn't arrived yet.
Tom knew exactly what Mary meant.
She has been dyeing her hair black for years.
I'm not doing this for the money.
Mary is mine.
Who else uses it?
The sooner you leave, the better.
You know your stuff.
I am counting on you.
She retaliated against him by ignoring him.
That wouldn't be fair.
The last time I spoke to Tom, he said he wasn't planning to go to Boston.
I thought I'd go with Tom.
They're gone.
I'm not sure whether to stay home or go out.
It's no use worrying about it. There's nothing you can do.
I don't dream.
We're going up into the mountains, so why don't you come with us?
It is because he is honest that I like him.
Tom talked about himself.
I can't reach any of the books on the top shelf.
Maybe I should become a painter.
They'll find her.
What will your husband think?
It's just a dream.
The garden can't be seen from the outside.
How did you get that black eye?
I think we can do it.

Are you really interested in that?

Don't leave me alone.
My idea is different from yours.
I would rather stay at home than go to the movies tonight.
Many people were there.
He'll be back in a few minutes.
You could've saved me a lot of trouble if you'd told me about that earlier.

Call me when you get there.
Don't you think if there were a problem, Tom would call us and let us know?
We never asked you to do that.
You may go.
That'll be good.
He's on his last legs.

Tom looked very good.
Tom watched TV yesterday.
How will you dispose of this problem?
Will you go to the meeting in my place?
Do you need me, Tom?
Tom has only fifteen minutes to eat his lunch.
It's naive of you to believe that.
It would be a pity if such a word were to disappear.
Where's Tom going?
Don't pressure Tom.
Tom did that for Mary.
We'll work tomorrow.
Tom loves to read.
I ate nothing but bread and butter.
He had breakfast all alone.
He has some money in the bank.
Tom tried to trick us.
Do you want this?
Just because he likes painting doesn't mean he's good at painting.
He was born poor, but died a millionaire.
Do you really think this is a good idea?
I can't really do anything until Tom gets here.
He goes to bed early but it takes him a long time to get to sleep.
That's a bad sign.
The room is at the end of the hall.
They have lived in this town for ten years.
There have been a lot of complaints about that policy.
Scented soaps tended to make her skin itch.
Tom didn't want to play dodge ball because he was tired.
Shut your big mouth.
Did you remember to thank Tom?
He was driven by revenge.
Did you happen to bring a blanket?
He amazed everyone by passing his driving test.
In Japan people drive on the left.
I was a teacher for fifteen years.
Tom put a dish with cheese and crackers on the table.
I don't want to take a walk now.
He chose them at random.
Tom was very rich.
I thought I told you never to call me while I'm at the office.
Why isn't that good?
There still weren't any visible signs of spring.
The moon emerged from behind the cloud.
Bring it back when you're done.
Would you give me a cigarette?
You are a good cook.
Tom told John that he would ask Mary to the dance only if John asked Alice.
You should sleep.
Some children were playing frisbee near the pond.
May I eat a little of it?
I've spoken to your parents about your behavior.
Look at what you've done.
All that you have to do is to follow his advice.
I said go home.
Does Tom know that you're here?
The radio is too loud. Can't you turn it down a little?
It's for Tom.
They eat fish on Fridays.
Such a plan can hardly succeed.
What he is saying does not make sense.
You can probably guess what happens though.
The future looked very gloomy.
Watch what you're doing!
I was fired.
I know he is busy.
My car is not running.
What do you do on Sunday?
Both of them started laughing.
Yours was better.
I didn't sign anything.
Tom will call you later.
Tom doesn't know whether Mary is younger or older than he is.
Have you ever seen a bear in this area?
Show me how to do it, please.
Tom's eyesight isn't as good as it used to be.
The people in the other room are speaking French.
Tom signed the guest book.
Can you throw a fastball?
It occurred to me that I should not keep it secret.
I teach French at a nearby junior high school.
Tom taught Mary a lot of useful French.
Tom's had his fair share of problems lately.
Keep doing what you're doing.
Open your eyes.
Tom is out.
You had better have your car washed.
What on earth do you want to talk to Tom about?
She doesn't have many friends.
He called for beer.
We have time enough to eat.
You made the right call.
A samurai, even when he has not eaten, uses a toothpick like a lord.
We often hear French being spoken here.
I'm a little bit tired.
Which of the two ways do you choose?
He put down his thoughts in his notebook.
Do you know what's in that box?
Three times three is nine.
I think it'd be great if you could come.
Is it still raining?
He has ten cows.
Be sure to put out the fire before you leave.
The chairman opened the meeting.
I'd like to know what your opinion is.
Florence is the most beautiful city in Italy.
My stomach is grumbling.
Maybe your name really is Tom.
You're beginning to try my patience.
Tom reluctantly gave Mary the money she asked for.
Goodbye and good luck.
Tom looked good.
You aren't alone.
Show me an example.
Why's it bothering you?
Just put those packages anywhere.
I ought to have written the letter yesterday.
I didn't know you had a sense of humor.
I can't move my leg.
It is beneath him to say such a thing.
I'll be right with you.
Somebody has to be here for Tom.
Why would anyone do that on purpose?
You don't smoke, do you?
Tom knows a lot about computers.
Maybe you should learn how to use a gun.
Do you think children born today will have better lives than their parents?
My battery is dead.
Tom remained a bachelor his whole life.
We had a secret meeting.
Come and help me out.
How was your birthday?
What made you want to become an anesthesiologist?
Tom doesn't have much time to waste.
Do you have any money?
I can't give it to you.
Tom misses his family.
I haven't finished that job yet.
The first time Tom brought Mary home, his mother said, "This one's a keeper."
I'm a light sleeper.
Tom made us do it.
Did it not occur to you to close the windows?
How do you know that, Tom?
At first, I didn't know what to do.
I had two cups of coffee.
Are you interested in me?
We don't have another choice.
We should've let the police handle the problem.
Tom said that he was very hungry.
I don't feel like it.
Tom is a well-known painter.
Tom was in the cabin.
It is difficult planning meals for so many people.
He's stalling for time.
I love pizza.
Tom didn't notice that his fly was open.
It's improved.
Clear off the table.
I ate a hot dog for lunch.
When I grow up, I'm going to get married to Tom.
She got her master's degree three years ago.
Strawberries are expensive in the winter.
Tom knew.
We do all kinds of repairs.
I'll be waiting outside.
What does it look like I'm doing?
Tom motioned for Mary to keep quiet.
It's a little late for that, isn't it?
France is to the south of England.
Tom's mother has died.
I'll probably be a great-grandfather by the time I'm 75.
How frequently do you check your mail?
Lay the book on the table.
Does Tom think Mary likes him?
Tom sat patiently.
Everything is all right.
The school is on top of the hill.
I couldn't make myself understood in French.
The police asked Tom to wear a wire.
It's rather cold today, but I think it'll be fairly warm tomorrow.
Tom said you'd know what to do.
Tom may have told Mary about it.
I gave that to Tom.
She made the same mistake as before.
Don't promise anything.
To the best of my knowledge, he will not come.
Tom was good at playing the violin.
Tom noticed that Mary looked worried.
The most logical place to keep your spare tire is in the trunk of your car.
We need to stop Tom before he hurts himself.
Tom thinks he knows what Mary is doing.
I think you've got what I need.
It's getting cloudy.
Everything he says is true.
He wanted to test his limits.
We haven't been able to find out why we weren't allowed to enter that building.
Don't underestimate it.
I love Tom.
How did you know where to find me?
Are you celebrating Christmas?
Tom's face feels rough because he needs to shave.
I'm going to Australia again next month.
He went so far as to call me a liar.
You are tired, aren't you?
Give me the key.
Tom seemed fine.
Tom couldn't talk about his ordeal with anyone.
Tom can't keep cleaning up after you.
Tom is wearing a mask.
It's already been taken care of.
Thanks Tom, I appreciate it.
Tom doesn't always obey his parents.
The nurse removed Tom's bandages.
We want to know why.
Tom dreams of world peace.
I'm old enough to live by myself.
Do you know if Tom has already eaten?
I thought Tom had enough money to live on.
Everybody had a hard time.
I'm going to the village tomorrow.
Please take good care of yourself.
It didn't really hurt.
I can neither confirm nor deny this.
What do you have here?
A fuse has blown.
Tom doesn't want to be rich.
He boils water in a coffee pot.
The man reading a paper over there is my uncle.
You rarely ever wake up this early.
Maybe you should just fire Tom.
There's a possibility that the man was murdered.
You keep out of this.
I don't feel like sleeping anymore.
Tom looks a lot older than he really is.
I didn't see anyone.
Grab as much as you need.
Tom is very generous.
I recognized Tom.
Tom will try to talk Mary out of it.
She'll lend you a book.
Tom is still in bed.
This medicine helps relieve muscle pain.
How can I lose weight more quickly?
Money can't buy life.
Nobody loves war.
Tom and Mary were sitting across the table from John and Alice.
Tom closed the door when he left the room.
Tom could be involved.
She must be from the South.
The piano needs to be tuned.
What do you think of my new hat?
There are many stores in this area.
I knew you wouldn't forget Tom.
Tom is going to love doing that.
Who's the guy over there?
Your bag is on my desk.
You could drive home by yourself.
We presented a watch to him.
Open the window and let some fresh air into the room, please.
Do you think Tom will like the concert?
How was your date with Tom?
I'm used to staying up late.
It looks like Tom is flirting with Mary.
A good deed never goes unpunished.
It has been raining since Sunday.
That could be a coincidence.
Tom and Mary seldom speak to each other in French.
I'm not as tall as he is.
I'm about to take Tom home.
Please don't sit on that bench.
Do you think we can find someone to replace Tom?
Her beauty was beyond description.
Peel the orange and give me a piece.
We can do without those.
If she had told me the truth, I wouldn't be angry.
Tom plunged to his death.
It's a very simple idea.
The police broke up the fight.
Why do you have only two cars?
I saw the light at the end of the tunnel.
Tom often helps Mary with her homework.
Get lost!
You disgust me.
You're out of order.
He talked to himself.
I have doubts.
It was the perfect moment for a kiss.
This is what I want to do.
I've got money.
Everyone in our class passed the exam.
Tom is doing very well.
That would be awfully sweet of you.
I can see what you mean.
I continued working.
The devil always finds a way to make something bad even worse.
I'm sure I saw her two years ago.
Am I hurting you?
Tom walked down the street.
Where is my wallet? Nevermind! I just found it under the couch.
Tom didn't know Mary had already done that.
You may not smoke in this room.
I don't want to help you.
He might have lost his way.
Be careful where you step.
One of my friends wants to move in with me.
Do you have any grandchildren?
Do Martians speak English?
She carried that table by herself.
I'd like to see someone do better.
Go and wake Mary up.
Come back later.
Have a piece of pie.
That's not how the world works.
Why didn't you say goodbye?
She knitted her father a sweater.
I was planning on telling you today.
I never understood why Tom liked Mary so much.
I'll get Tom to do that for you.
I have some pretty exciting news.
Did you want to see me?
That castle was built in ancient times.
I've lived here most of my life.
Why is Tom digging a hole in his backyard?
I don't think I'll go to Boston.
These are ours.
Tom isn't honest.
We should hang out more often.
I'm happy that Tom is happy.
The station is located between these two towns.
I usually wear jeans on Sunday.
If you didn't put this here, then who did?
Give that to me, please.
Did Tom make you cry?
I picked you some flowers.
When Tom was a kid, he used to pretend he was playing the drums by tapping his fingers on the kitchen table, to the great irritation of his father.
Nothing scares me.
Tom is easy to talk to.
Do you want fruit juice?
When was the last time you had a bath?
Goats can eat almost anything.
I hope that all your dreams come true.
Einstein liked to play the violin.
I had to part with my competent secretary.
I'll ask my mother for money.
We walked for about 6 kilometers.
Tom seemed to be in a good mood.
Everything will turn out for the best.
Did you consider other alternatives?
I must have the wrong number.
What you said surprised me.
Would you mind repeating the question?
I hate chemistry.
We live on the third floor.
I agree completely.
Wait until tomorrow.
Go back to your room.
Why are you holding my hands?
Have you ever been to Kyushu?
I have no one to play with.
I take my job seriously.
Tom looked at the letter.
Tom said I was fat.
I haven't talked to anyone lately.
Is this your favorite song?
Take this medicine.
And then what happened?
Do you have to work on Sundays?
I am explaining the rules.
Tom found the watch he had lost.
I know your father very well.
Is something the matter with Tom?
Tom may do whatever he wants.
I took care of my sick sister.
How can I tell if a girl likes me?
I swim almost every day.
What you said is true.
He failed the exam because he had not studied enough.
The lawyers argued the case for hours.
I came here with my mom.
The train left two hours ago.
Tom is caught between a rock and a hard place.
My lips are sealed.
I was very busy yesterday.
What's your favorite cheap wine?
Did you see Tom leave?
She had to accept her fate.
You killed Tom.
Tom is the one who showed me how to do it.
Tom didn't admit his mistake.
If you are to succeed, you must try harder.
We'll save this piece of cake for Tom.
I am not a teacher.
He went blind from the accident.
Tom said that he thought I looked lonely.
That was the moment of truth.
What were Tom and Mary doing in Boston?
She wanted to go out anyway.
It's eight o'clock at night.
He is eager for the chance to prove himself.
Wash your feet.
Money is needed.
Defend yourselves.
Thank you for coming to see me.
I'm very busy.
Tom thought about it.
After walking for an hour, we stopped to take a rest.
Tom believes in equality between women and men.
Tom closed his eyes and thought about Mary.
You can't leave me here alone.
I think we've seen enough.
My dream is to go to Japan.
I grew up in a small town.
Do you want some soup?
Would you be so kind as to let me borrow your cell phone, please?
The library is on the second floor.
You don't need to wait.
Tom, I want you to speak to Mary.
Don't talk about yourself like that.
I didn't commit myself to attend the meeting.
I'm stunned.
Tom can't do this.
You aren't busy, are you?
Do you have many friends?
There are some things we can change if we only try.
He speaks English and French.
None of the meat was fit to eat.
I stepped aside for him to pass.
You don't need to thank us.
Speak to the manager of the firm.
I was on the list.
Tom filled his bucket with sand and turned it over.
You really should talk to Tom.
Tom giggled again.
Tom went down the river on a rubber raft.
You're in big trouble.
I don't say it without reason.
I don't have time to take a break.
What is it you want to know?
Please tell me you're kidding.
I believe he is coming tomorrow.
What do you have for me today?
It's hard to find good help these days.
I almost told Tom what you told me not to tell him.
I want to make a good impression.
Her hair was long enough to reach the floor.
Do you know how old I am?
I think I remember how to do that.
We had some visitors yesterday.
I went to elementary school in Boston.
I have to go shopping.
I haven't forgotten you.
What language do you two use to communicate?
I like the color of your skirt.
She did not read the book.
Tom is a science teacher.
What is it with you and Tom?
I'll make sure Tom does what we asked him to do.
Tom really likes swimming a lot.
She lost her money, her family and her friends.
Tom stood on the sidewalk talking to Mary.
In what kind of situations would you do that?
Can you correct this report before 5:00 p.m.?
A crowd was gathering around him.
He knows how to tell lies.
Why didn't you call me last night?
Tom wants to go.
I wouldn't get my hopes up.
She never stays long.
Where did you live last year?
Here is your bag.
I can't talk to women.
I am uncomfortable in these new shoes.
This is my father's.
My truck is parked over there.
Do you want another one of these?
Both of them are very brilliant.
What is the temperature?
I was wondering what changed your mind.
Sadly, many Japanese people died.
I don't know if I can ever trust you again.
You have the right to consult a lawyer.
Is Mary your daughter?
I need them.
Who told Tom that?
The explanation was beyond my understanding.
My mother boiled ten eggs.
Do you have a bike?
I hope Tom comes over to my place today.
Tom was about to complain, but decided against it.
She has never danced with him.
That can't be Mary. She's in the hospital now.
I am accustomed to cold weather.
He told me to speak more slowly.
That poor lady is disabled.
Problems don't usually go away by themselves.
This is a life-sized statue.
Is the job too much for you?
Why are you being so nice to me?
We don't know what Jesus looked like.
We're going to miss you.
Tom doesn't like beef.
My parents pushed me to quit the baseball club.
Which is more valuable, time or money?

When was the last time you did the dishes?
Make your bed.
Control yourself.
Did you wash your hair?
I've got some questions for you.
Tom and Mary are looking for John.
I want to go to Australia.
Tom took a folded piece of paper out of his pocket.
Tom had a date with Mary last night.
Let's play this Sunday.
He likes chicken nuggets.
Wait and see.
Tom may do as he likes.
Why can't you come?
I already feel much better.
Tom noticed the wedding ring on Mary's finger.
It was a long time ago.
What would you have done in my place?
Just saying you don't like fish because of the bones is not really a good reason for not liking fish.
I want Tom to go home.
Tom was wearing moccasins.
Be very careful with that blue box.
Tom didn't care how it got done as long as it got done.
You're absolutely right.
Do I have to do it right away?
Give me another chance.
Make love, not war.
Tom isn't stable.
She heard him scream.
Tom took a shower before breakfast.
Tom is headed this way.
I've promised Tom I wouldn't do that anymore.
My ballpoint pen just ran out of ink.
Tom is used to making quick decisions.
I just wanted to say thank you for all your help.
They don't like my friends.
He was surprised to learn this.
It's only a stone's throw away from where I was born.
She was fond of talking about herself.
Did you bring yours?
What's your Skype username?
She tried it herself.

I did so for the sake of my health.
I know what Tom likes.
She is looked up to by her friends.
I'm going to empty this cabinet so that you can use it.
Am I so different from you?
I went over to where Tom was.
Nowadays many people travel by car.
Tom kept whistling.
He found her irresistible.
Can you whistle?
I've been trying to cut down on caffeine.
This is the most beautiful sight that I have ever seen.
How much is a ticket to Segovia?
A lot of people who have up until now been spending money having a good time now need to be more careful with their money.
She dressed like a boy.
Why are you at home?
I get chapped lips every winter.
Your secret will be safe with me.
Tom was killed by wild animals.
My salary doesn't allow us to live extravagantly.
You're always drinking alone.
I borrowed 1,000 yen from my cousin.
Saddam rejected the demand.
He took something out of his pocket.
I'll do whatever you want.
I'd rather not do domestic work.
He politely corrected me.
She is going to be six next year.
Time passes quickly.
I can drive a car, but Tom can't.
It is the oldest wooden building in existence.
There are a few boats on the lake.
Stop that!
She always smiles at me.
He is better than me at math.
They offered it to me.
You're very versatile.
Some of what you said sounded stupid.

Tom has a son named John.
Only a few drops of rain have fallen.
If it were true, what would you do?
This book is easy to read, since it's written in simple English.
We watched the soccer game on TV.
I have no clue.
Empty your bags.
Tom is allergic to eggs.
When Tom bought his car, he didn't know that it had been involved in a serious accident.
I wouldn't want you to think I was stupid.
When I woke up this morning, the rain had turned into snow.
I am more beautiful than you.
Tom eventually found a job that he liked.
I have three years of experience.
Tom sat down on the edge of the bed.
Every school kid has played hooky at one time or another.
I don't trust banks.
Work is due to begin tomorrow.
Keep the child away from the pond.
He has started acting strangely.
What's your favorite type of restaurant to go to?
Can she come in time?
No matter what you say, I won't change my mind.
I'm no longer afraid of dogs.
It's all a terrible misunderstanding.
Tom told the taxi driver to turn left.
Tom can fix just about anything.
The cat has started acting strangely.
What do you like about it?
Did you say your name was Tom?
You will find the restaurant on your right.
Why are you avoiding me?
When was the last time I told you I loved you?
I have not had anything to eat since this morning.
Isn't Tom supposed to be the boss?
He told me the truth.
I'd like to ask a favor of you.
It's a pity Tom can't come to your party.
Someone opened the window.
Why do people do things like that?
Do you want to dance with me?
Our plans are taking shape.
Tom is not often wrong.
Greece cancels the referendum.
Tom gave me a pen.
You can't make me do anything I don't want to do.
I'm nervous and excited.
Tom doesn't like you very much.
Will you please put the baby to bed?
The teacher enjoyed talking with some of the graduates.
When did you finish writing the letter?
Most experts think a lot of his theory.
It being a fine day, I went out for a walk.
Your story is hard to believe.
I stayed home all day instead of going to work.
The students pretended that they couldn't hear the teacher.
All the houses on my street lost power this morning due to the storm.
Tom was very poor.
He wrote on the social evolution of Japan.
Did you bring a weapon?
Don't touch the flowers.
Tom's mother packed the picnic basket with sandwiches.
Don't think I don't appreciate what you've done.
Tom discovered two dead bodies in his basement.
Are you sure about the cost of that car?
You may stay here as long as you like.
I don't need your charity.
I thought about it.
Tom regrets not doing what his father recommended.
It's up to you to decide what to do.
This room has air conditioning.
That girl is more cute than beautiful.
You're not a very good liar, Tom.
Don't you want to hear my side of the story?
He always values his wife's opinions.
Tom is drenched.
That's a wise choice.
Is there an air gauge here?
He is at his desk.
Don't let anyone else tell you otherwise.
Tom'll call.
I would like to buy a sofa.
They're quicker than we are.
Now is the time.
What are you implying?
That's not why.
Tom knows a lot about dogs.
Tom looked through the menu.
You have friends who can help you, don't you?
Tom closed his laptop and stood up.
The moon is exceptionally pretty tonight.
I love his son.
I am very tired.
He's really into soccer.
The party took place in a big room.
They're cold.
My grandfather was an archaeologist.
What is it you're afraid of?
Tom moved a little closer to see what was happening.
Tom looked at his footprints in the sand.
His family didn't have much money.
This book is missing two pages.
He likes animals.
I'll take that as a compliment.
He walked across the street.
Tom passed out from the pain.
Tom smiled admiringly.
Where did you buy your schoolbag?
She's an intelligent young woman.
Did you write down Tom's number?
Tom isn't in Boston.
Could I have a piece of cheesecake?
The delivery of the goods was delayed due to the storm.
You are old enough to know this.
Open this door.
I bought the book for ten dollars.
How's your brother?
Did Tom say where he went for his summer vacation?
Can you tell me who they are?
No one is listening to Tom.
A thick mist covered the countryside.
Who was it?
He is tired of reading.
We can't see it.
Tom told the men sitting around the table that he'd never played poker before.
She married a sailor.
This is just too big to carry.
Tom has already done everything we've asked him to do.
Tom asked Mary about her new job in Boston.
I can see why Tom doesn't want to go.
Don't climb up the wall.
I didn't get your name.
We can't save everybody.
Why are your eyes red?
Yes, he actually said that.
The building was totally destroyed by the earthquake.
I apologize for what's happened here.
I have a bath almost every day.
They say she's good at cooking.
I walk my dog along the river every morning.
I am Japanese.
Tom is chopping firewood.
Tom wanted to teach Mary a lesson.
Are you sure you didn't do anything?
I don't know what else Tom told you, but I do know he doesn't always tell the truth.
I like Korean cuisine.
We don't know how to use it.
Killing him is the easiest solution.
I'm not able to fix the computer.
It must be past midnight.
I don't hold grudges.
I want to spend my life with you.
I tried to help him.
You are a doctor.
You won't be needing that where you're going.
Are those my glasses?
He didn't attend the meeting.
This one's on us, Tom.
The thermometer went down below zero.
I know you want to come home.
You were right about Tom.
My turn comes next.
It's not about the money, is it?
Wherever you go, you see a lot of bicycles left on sidewalks near stations.
I had to buy some food.
You should write Tom a thank-you letter.
Come home.
African elephants have bigger ears than Asian elephants.
I had fun doing that.
You can't hurt me any more than you already have.
I looked down on Mt. Fuji from the window of the plane.
Parents teach their children that it's wrong to lie.
I hardly ever get sick.
I know what to watch for.
The job's not done yet.
I think that she's honest.
Tom hardly ever acts his age.
When he finds out, he won't be happy.
Tom would never hurt you.
I think I'll go and get Tom.
Tom, Mary, John and Alice all enjoy dancing.
Tom made me say those things.
I don't want to stop working.
I wonder if you would mind lending me your car for a couple of days.
Please don't open the window.
Go and help Tom.
Tom makes me feel young.
You can stay here as long as you want.
He acts as if he were a king.
I would like to have a look at your collection of stamps.
He married a rich girl.
Tom wanted to live in Boston.
Birds of a feather flock together.
We still don't know the truth.
If you want peace, prepare for war.
Let's see what we can find out.
If walls could talk, what stories would they tell us?
She decided to marry him.
He has a prejudice against foreigners.
Who was the woman you were talking to?
I understand you met with Tom recently.
I shouldn't have stayed up late yesterday.
She must be well off.

Tom wanted you to see it right away.
Let's get started.
I'm not giving up.
Is Tom smiling?
He was lying on the grass.
It doesn't ring a bell.
They did not listen.
If you think that's necessary, you should do it.
Who should I vote for?
I will see you on next Tuesday, that is to say, the 10th of September.
Why didn't you tell anyone?
What countries border on Slovenia?
Be brief.
Where can we meet you?
It is likely to rain today.
You weren't that bad.
This book is too difficult for me to read.
My sister is a nurse.
How did you convince them?
She divorced him.
That was not the only problem.
The mountain is green.
The children soon fell asleep.
I didn't understand your question.
Our escape was nothing short of a miracle.
Tom still loves Mary even though she doesn't love him anymore.
I acted as a simultaneous interpreter.
How long do you want it for?
He is nothing but a liar.
My baby brother sleeps ten hours a day.
Do you think Tom is coming to the party?
What's your favorite subject at school?
This is the temple which we used to visit.
I don't know how to use it.
Tom would never hurt his children.
This is simply not true.
Your problem is you don't study enough.
This must be changed.
That's news to me.
It's important for us to think about the future of the world.
You just can't ignore it.
My wife is cooking right now.
No matter how busy you are, you have to do your homework.
They say we are going to have a severe winter.
He's back from his travels in Central Asia.
The sisters lived to be 100 years old.
I have to buy flowers for my girlfriend.
He is not married.
Tom knew it was going to be tough to convince Mary that she was too old to drive.
Tom is mad at Mary.
Thanks for staying with me.
We stayed overnight in Hakone.
This is utter nonsense.
My back hurts.
Almost a third of the gunshot victims were teenagers.
You can expect me tomorrow.
I have no idea where we are or where we're going.
All you care about is money.
That wasn't so bad, was it?
You're amazing.
"Do you think she'll come?" "I hope not."
He still wants to come.
I have never been to America.
Who succeeded?
Why are you ruining my life?
He's a community leader.
I'm glad to see that you're happy.
This car is as good as new.
You have nothing to be ashamed of.
Write with a pen, not with a pencil.
I don't think Tom has met Mary yet.
Come here. I want to show you something.
I believe that the boy is honest.
They are all very happy.
I was living in Boston a few years ago.
I don't have a bathing suit.
Tom is on the night shift this week.
Why is he hiding?
I'll see what Tom thinks.
We'll soon know the truth.
She wasn't a bit impatient.
That hurts! Stop it!
If I had had more money, I would have bought the pen.
Can I turn on the radio?
January is the first month of the year.
Why don't you have a drink?
I found something.
Tom ate dinner about one hour ago.
Get out of my office.
Why did I get a D?
Tom often goes there to play chess.
I wonder if Tom is still wealthy.
My wife died of cancer.
Tell Tom I won't need his help.
What bus do I take to get to Rampa?
Sickness prevented him from going out.
Stop! You're making him cry.
The cause of the fire is not known.
That's not a proper thing to say.
Tom will take it.
I'm swamped with work.
There's no reason for you to do that.
Take a closer look.
Right now I'm at the airport.
I love pandas.
Why did you paint the bench red?
A bad habit, once formed, is difficult to get rid of.
I forgot the key to my room.
Don't let us down.
Tom was afraid to tell his parents.
She didn't tell me her name.
Don't put the glass near the edge of the table.
I don't go on blind dates.
That's dangerous.
What else do you know?
How are we going to do it?
You cannot kill yourself by holding your breath.
Nothing is more important than friendship.
Tom only drinks coffee.
This thing isn't over yet.
How long did you stay at the party?
I hope to see you the next time you are in Tokyo.
Like father, like son.
You'll find out.
Tom thought Mary could get a job.
Try on both these coats and compare them.
I'm with my family right now.
You'd better come in.
Did Tom ever hurt you?
Come on, let's take shelter.
How many foreign languages do you know?
Give me a telephone call when you get back.
I never play the saxophone anymore.
Are you spying on me?
She asked him how to get to the station.
The computer is new.
No one knows the future.
Tom's blood pressure is normal.
Can we join in?
It is up to you to see to it that such a thing doesn't happen.
I've got more books than I can read.
Tom is a dad, too.
Each person paid one thousand dollars.
If your father asks your mother a question in French, does she answer in French or in English?
Her speech bored me.
Tom gave Mary a lift home.
The little girl grew into a beautiful woman.
There's a hole in this sock.
I played with Tom and Mary today.
I didn't realize what I was doing.
Let's talk about that over drinks.
Tom needs to see me right away.
Tom is a fast talker.
He catches colds easily.
That flower has a strong smell.
I've saved you a seat next to me.
Tom will always love you.
You look just like him.
I can't even cook an omelet.
They have a ten-year-old son.
Tom sat down beside Mary on the bench.
I heard you were looking for a lawyer.
How do you like that?
Tom left his son a fortune.
A friend in need is a friend indeed.
You're losing.
Tom and Mary are thinking about getting a divorce.
Does Tom like to swim?
I got your messages.
Your husband is a very lucky man.
I'm surprised you weren't invited.
Tom tried to mount the horse.
I should learn some French.
Don't you think you can do better?
He and I are friends.
The boy standing over there is my son.
Tom is one of nicest guys I know.
We drove through unfamiliar territory.
The story of his brave struggle affected us deeply.
I like watching movies in French.
Tom wasn't angry.
I don't believe everything Tom tells me.
Tom might know why Mary has to do that.
You're wasting your time.
You remind me of your father.
What will we be doing this time next week?
I love this mobile phone.
That's what we think.
You won't catch anything.
Tom seems unusual.
I often study while listening to music.
She writes to me once a month.
I wonder what will happen.
She finished her coffee and asked for another.
You're both insane.
Make sure that nobody enters.
This is our friend Tom.
This hat goes together with the dress.
Tom lies.
Tom and Mary think they know everything.
The last thing I want to do is cause you any more pain.
He has been driving for hours.
I've ordered two teas and three coffees.
Is it true that you can't swim?
My younger brother watches TV.
I expect you to treat Tom with respect.
Tom isn't going to like that.
I really don't want to live here.
The problem is as good as settled.
I can't detect any pattern.
Have you ever been to Mexico?
You're kidding me.
He got tired soon.
Tom's very nice.
There's not a chance.
What he said applies, to a certain extent, to this case.
She is ashamed of what she's done.
If you see or hear anything, let me know.
What's the temperature going to be tomorrow?
Tom doesn't want to talk to Mary right now.
He can read and write.
I hope Tom comes soon.
Do you have any CDs?
I'll start.
I don't work in Boston.
I ate a banana.
Please insert a coin.
We can do a lot more.
Answer me right now.
It was a blow to us.
Do you need an ambulance?
Tom and Mary quickly got into their car and drove away.
I have misjudged you.
May I ask you a question?
He's two years older than I am, but he's shorter than I am.
I'd like to open a bank account.
I read your letter yesterday.
I had breakfast at 7:30.
Light the candles.
We are sure of his success.
Perhaps he'll never become famous.
I'm taking Tom with me.
I can't remember how I got here.
This isn't funny.
The police are watching us from across the street.
Tom looks like a friendly guy.
I told Tom not to worry.
The price was only three thousand yen, or about thirty dollars.
I've always been impressed by how well you speak French.
How many hours did you work this week?
You're shallow and materialistic.
He'd prefer to go on Friday.
Look ahead.
She left the room without saying goodbye.
I'd like some aspirin.
Tom forgot to feed Mary's dog.
I've known you for years.
Tom looks amused.
Are those yours?
I'm old, but I'm not that old.
The exact temperature is 22.68 degrees Celsius.
He impressed me with his magic tricks.
Do the children go to school?
I need about a minute.
Tom showed up at about 2:30.
When I was a child, I used to swim in that pond.
The accent of "guitar" falls on the second syllable.
I'll get my bag.
The teacher was very angry.
My grandparents' house doesn't have running water.
Tom is narrow-minded.
Even a broken clock is right twice a day.
You should take a day off.
You shouldn't have brought Tom with you.
Those scientists are the cream of the crop.
My sister asked me to lend her the dictionary.
You should eat vegetables.
Peel the potatoes and the carrots.
Horses are easily spooked.
It happened just like this.
My hobby is collecting stamps.
That's what you want, isn't it?
This highway saves us a lot of time.
I cried all morning.
Tom walked down the street whistling a happy tune.
I love the way you laugh.
How did the traffic accident happen?
They talked all night.
Why is it that you are always late?
This novel isn't as good as his last one.
Stop trying.
I don't think I understand you.
Who's your favorite singer-songwriter?
Did Tom do anything?
Did you propose to Mary?
The plane took off at 2:30.
Tom slept late.
This one is Tom's.
I fear nothing.
I want something sweet.
My watch is very precise.
I'd like to rent your most inexpensive car for a week.
I'm Tom's stepbrother.
I want to eat something sweet.
Tom came to Boston to look for a job.
Tom is pretty upset.
Please leave Tom alone.
What you do is more important than what you say.
Tom was thunderstruck.
I got your messages.
I had to climb over the fence.
Those are my things.
Do you get along well with your new classmates?
Tell Tom which bus to take.
How do you like these poems?
My son won't listen to me.
His mobile has been stolen.
I was hungry and angry.
You may take the book.
I thought you'd decided against it.
I need to speak with you right away.
He's our only suspect.
We can just about read each other's minds.
Apparently, Tom was late because there was a traffic jam on Rt. 19.
You've earned it.
I am a Muslim.
He's an oceanographer.
There's got to be an answer.
I'd like for you to go.
Stop telling me what to do and mind your business.
All the words underlined in red should be checked for spelling.
You don't have a good memory.
She laughed the way schoolgirls do, with her hand over her mouth.
That would be a terrible way to die.
You don't have to be alone anymore.
I have to be up at six.
Look, there's a rabbit!
I'll stay if you want.
She was slightly better yesterday.
Don't be too sure.
Have we met before?
I know what Tom wants.
There's still a lot left to do, so I won't get bored.
I'll do what Tom says.
How did you get so good at French?
Don't let yourself be provoked into saying something that you'll regret.
It was stupid of you to have turned down the offer.
My sister dropped her plate on the floor.
It wasn't the first time.
It looks like your dog is thirsty.
Tom shouldn't have interfered.
Tom will never notice the difference.
Would you like to order dessert?
The sky grew darker and darker.
My brother doesn't swim.
I drew a moustache on Mary's picture.
You can't keep something that big a secret.
We must deal with the problem instantly.
I'm going to go find a doctor.
Just look at those legs.
I'd like to insure this, please.
There's a new girl in school.
I never asked Tom.
She is always finding fault with her husband.
Look there.
Isn't that what we anticipated?
Give me another example.
The young engineer lacked experience.
When you leave, I'll miss you.
If you don't want to do it, you don't have to.
I can cook better than I can play tennis.
He is in the habit of staying up late at night.
The article was well researched and insightful.
The theater group performed the new play.
I figured that you wouldn't want to go there without me.
Do it once again.
At least he shook your hand. He didn't even look at me.
"Thanks for the help." "Don't mention it."
I hope you enjoyed reading this book as much as I enjoyed writing it.
What a coincidence meeting you here!
We are anxious for world peace.
Could you come to my office when you have a moment?
It'll take a long time.
You smell good.
I hate rainy days.
Don't worry.
Wash your hands with soap.
I'm glad you invited me.
I feel feverish.
When were you in Boston?
I assume you are talking about Tom.
I'm learning German now.
Tom struck the wall with his fist.
No one knew a thing.
I have failed.
My father is out in the garden now.
You're lying!
Tom is relentless.
In the next four years, 15 billion euros must be saved.
My father is a businessman.
There's the bell.
I've asked you repeatedly to do that.
They took the subway.
I've never done it like that before.
Tom came into the room, carrying a bunch of flowers.
Tom's virtually admitted that it was his fault.
Tom turned on the TV.
You must be crazy.
You're more beautiful now than the day I first met you.
The baby cannot walk yet.
They aren't related.
I like movies.
Mary said that her parents would kill her if they found out that she was going out with Tom.
She is as poor as ever.
Tom caught three fish this afternoon.
Tom has many powerful friends.
The meat was tender.
Tom is smarter than I am.
It is time to go to school.
Don't you know her name?
You shall not marry my daughter!
Can't you work any faster than that?
The antelope ran away.
Tom doesn't want you here.
I have spent a lot of money on my house.
I am sorry, but this telephone is out of order.
Do you enjoy studying French?
She is in the kitchen because she's making dinner.
That would be perfect.

I wish I could control my emotions.

Pour melted butter over the popcorn.
Where did you go?
I'll call Tom and see what he's doing.
I have to think.
I love hanging out with my friends.
We're intrigued.
I'll buy a new one.
Open the door and let in the dog.
I'll tell Tom you asked.
I don't need any more help.
You're the one I like.
Tom should've told us about that earlier.
I can't imagine what it must've been like.
Why did you open the door?
I'm going mad.
Tom is enjoying himself.
You're the most beautiful woman in the whole world.
Tom accepted Mary's offer.
I'm going to Japan with my girlfriend in August.
Nobody ever found her cat.
What's Tom going to do after he graduates?
Tom is really sorry.
You had better go to bed now.
I can't even do that.

I know that Tom is from Boston.
She's worked hard to save up money.
Streetcars run on electricity.
I want very much for you to understand.
I like playing chess.
I understand it, but I still don't agree with it.

We must protect our children.
Sometimes she tried talking to him about India.
It is freezing cold.
Tom doesn't know Mary's phone number.
Please put this into English.
He is sure to come.
This belongs to Tom.
Tom was unharmed.
Tom picked up his hat and put it back on.
You don't have to go, do you?
I've never lived in Boston.
They drank two bottles of wine.
I had him take my picture.
Everybody knows I hate Tom.
I'll stay a few more days.
Who survived?
Tom seemed hurt.
Tom said he was planning to wear a black tuxedo.
Someone tried to kill me.
My watch says 2:30.

You must pay in advance.
Why do you lie?
I want to see that again.

It's a bad time.
Different flowers bloom in each season.
I hope so.
Tom found Mary's diary.
I'd like to go out with you.
I'll go and ask Tom.

What happened then?
Don't work too much!
I was truly perplexed.
She bought him a car.
What's your favorite soccer team?
Are you looking for someone?
Everyone except Tom was wearing a tie.
I'm glad someone agrees with me for once.

Does Tom know that you like Mary?
Tom is totally into you.
I cannot eat anything today.

Is that the man whose wife was killed in the car accident?

If I were you, I wouldn't do so.
Although he was exhausted, he had to keep working.
Could you help me for ten minutes?
Nothing can be better than that.

That's why I don't like you.
I asked Tom to play my favorite song.
Look at your hands.

How could I help it?

I'm glad to see you back.
It's their fault.
Do you realize what you're doing?
Tom decorated it.

Tom was beginning to feel awkward.
Tom asked Mary to help him clean his office.
Don't let him touch it.

If you can't do the time, don't do the crime.
She wanted to be alone.
Can you cook well?
You look healthy.
What were you two doing there anyway?
When I got home, I realized that one of my suitcases had disappeared.
Are you sure you want to do it?

Do you have any small change?
I've changed my mind again.
He went to London via Paris.
Tom didn't make a good first impression.
Mary is Tom's cousin.
I do not fear death.
I need to make a few calls.
Time to get up.
My father's going to kill me.
How much did you bring?
We're the Jacksons.
Please stop it.
Give Tom a call.
Don't forget to take a camera with you.
Do you have any plans for the weekend?
Some of them are my friends.
If you want to see Tom, you have to hurry.
We talked about basketball.
Brad Pitt is an actor.

That student's studying sociology.
I can't repair the computer.
Tom was born in Boston in 2013.
I'm starting to wonder if this was a good idea.

I live in Japan.
Tom doesn't heed any advice from Mary.
Please stop laughing.
I gave Tom all my money.

Tom hopped into the car and put it in gear.
You should call your mother as soon as possible.
Is Mary your daughter?
I always feel hungry.
Why are you apologizing?
Do you have a car?
I intend to come with you.
Why do you care so much?
Tom never thought he'd have to come back here again.
I want to be paid in cash.
My job is easy and I have a lot of free time.
I can't stand it anymore.
I had little time to prepare the speech.
I will promise you nothing.
I know that Tom is more handsome than me.
It's going to stay that way.
I didn't put it there.
I'm depending on you.
What was your question?
Tomorrow is my day off.
I never claimed that I could speak French.
Tom plays tennis every day.
I thought you said you knew Tom.
I have to put a stamp on the envelope.
The store closes at seven.
You don't know this song, so don't try to sing along.
Come again any time.
I can sleep a lot better now.
He was not sure what to do.
Tom wanted to live.
I almost never watch TV.
Some people have even visited the moon.
Do you wear glasses?
I think Tom is a good leader.
He's an animal.
What'll you do with it?
His explanation was not satisfactory.
The negotiations have ended.
You dropped your pencil.

When was the last time that you did something for the first time?
I am tired because I had to study for this exam last night.
She has long hair.
I'll help you if you help me.
What method do you use to organize your files?

Do you like this blouse?
Clean up the room.
I can do that if you let me.

Don't open your umbrella in the hall.
You'll need to do that sooner or later.

Can you close the door?
Tom has changed his name to John.
I didn't know he had a weak heart.
When does the bank open?
Having finished lunch, we went skating.
I didn't want that to happen.
The boys laughed at Tom.
My plans failed miserably.
Give it a shot.
I've heard that.
Tom likes Mary, you know?
You look amazing.
Tom deserves this.
I'm certain I saw Tom.
There was a tall tree in front of my house.
I'll wait outside.

Where do you want it?
I like children. That's why I became a teacher.

I've never been to my uncle's house.
I don't get you.
Whatever you do, don't run.
I give you my word on it.
You may as well tell me the truth.
We've run out of tea.
That'll make me happy.
What did you come here for?
He didn't come on time.

Did Tom tell you?
I think I like it.
I realize I may not be the most desirable man in the world, but I still hope you'll consider going out with me.
I know a good place for dinner.
I'm just kidding. That really didn't happen.
You're such a liar.
Is that your house?

I can check that for you.
I still have mixed feelings about this.

She came to Tokyo when she was 18.
How serious are you?

That's something to think about.
Tom called Mary, but the line was busy.
This house is large enough for your family to live in.
Is your mother at home?
Tom and Mary live in Boston with their son.
I guess you are right.
Tom got wet to the skin and caught cold.
Nobody tells me anything.
We killed time by playing cards.

Her hair comes to her shoulders.
Show me another watch.

Before deciding, I would like to consult with my family.
Tom said that he didn't have a lot of money on him.
That's not what we do.
This is the most fun I've had in my life.
He is said to have been strong.
You'd probably really like it.
Is there something you want to tell me?

I have a half-sister.
Do you have an anger management problem?
It made Tom's head hurt to think about all those things.
I sent Tom back home.

We cannot thank you enough.
You're so set in your ways!

I like skiing much better than swimming.
I gave Tom one of those.
This is too hard a problem for me to solve.
If you don't ask her out, I will.
Tom will find you.
Tom seemed tense.
I didn't consider the subject seriously.
I don't like Tom so much.
Nobody visits Tom.
What time is it now?
That's crazy.
Have you called the boss already?
Would you please stop singing?
Nobody tried to help Tom.
We are very grateful for what you did.
That's sad.
I cannot possibly help you.
Can someone tell me why Tom is angry?
I don't have time to help you right now.
Each player did his best.
Tom hardly ever talks to Mary.
All of us live in the same dorm.
If you want to know, just ask.
May I borrow this CD?

I needed a place to sit down and rest.
That's huge.
Father isn't at home.
Do you have a stomachache?

Tom doesn't gamble, drink or smoke.
You're going the wrong way.
Do you know why Tom didn't win?
I made Tom laugh.
This CD belongs to her.
The man was dying.
Why didn't you just ask?
I outsmarted Tom.
He is pleased with his new car.
I don't think we'll have enough time.
I can't bear living alone.
I told you the concert was going to be boring. Why didn't you believe me?
I just want a straight answer. Nothing more.
We could make it on time if we walked a little faster.
Tom is old and deaf.
Tom ripped a page out of his sketch book.
He wasn't only fined, he also had to pay for damages.

What a charming couple!
Of course I believe you.
They were responsible for the accident.
What time do you usually have breakfast?
I quit smoking and drinking.
He hid his toys under the bed.
My husband thinks I spend too much money.
There isn't much money in this business.
Even my parents don't like me.
I don't know what I would do without you.
Every man has his price.
What did you expect?
Tom is finishing his work.
Thanks for helping me fix my car.
Tom always treats me like a child.
Does Tom still owe you money?
Are you seriously thinking about getting married again at your age?
It is very hot here in the summer.
You understand, don't you?
They are willing to talk about the problem.
We study French at school every day.
I can't leave until I find out who Tom is.
That's sweet of you.
You said you were ready.
Let's rest here.
Nobody tells me anything around this place.
I wish I had listened to your advice.
I should've left the gun where I found it.
I have no idea who that is either.
I saw her last week.
Tom said he liked what she had made for dinner, but he was only being polite.
I think Tom is in love with me.
You could've jeopardized the entire operation.
Did you know him well?
Change the subject.
That's none of your business.
In South America, there are many traces of Indian culture.
They accepted my point of view.
Einstein was a mathematical genius.

We're here.
She survived her husband by ten years.
"Are scientists close to cloning a human being?" "Not by a long shot."
Let me help you wipe it off.
How many days did you spend in Boston?
The girls laughed at Tom.
Tom is in pretty good shape for his age.
Tom and Mary aren't kidding.
It looks as if it is going to rain.
I've worked with Tom before.
I am afraid he is going to spill the beans.
What would you like to drink?
Just try it.
Tom fell off a ladder and broke both of his arms.
You're unusually quiet today.
It was you that made the mistake!
He is studying at his desk.
Life in a small town is boring.
Nobody can exist without food.
Tom saw that Mary was fast asleep in the hammock.

I appreciate your kindness.
They attend every meeting.
Tom opened the door for the dog.
That is mine. I don't know where yours is.
I can't even look at you.
It's only a temporary fix.
The soldier saved his friend at the cost of his own life.
I'll try to explain it to the best of my ability.
I won't be at the opening ceremony.
What've you got for me?
We met at summer camp.
They trusted you.
England imports Spanish produce.
I am afraid you have the wrong number.
Tom said that he was aching all over.
They wash their hands.
It will not last more than three minutes.
This book was printed in England.
I didn't know you were so ambitious.
Tom has a lot of friends in Boston.
That man standing near the door and that woman on the opposite side of the room next to the window have photographic memories.
Do you think Tom knows who we are?
Is there any possibility of his resigning?
Dinner's getting cold.
The mere sight of a dog frightens him.
Tom was my friend.
I thought Tom had answered all your questions.
Tom is like his father.
I'll know better next time.
I hope you don't get lost.
He is close to sixty.
She was living alone in a hut.
You aren't rich, are you?
The plane flew over Mt. Fuji.
She's a big teaser.
Tom and Mary got married last month.
I like that description.
Do you want milk in your coffee?
There is nothing to apologize for.
There's a swimming pool and a bowling alley.
I want you to take me with you.
What's the big idea?
Do you like to travel?
They talked politics.
I would like to be an English teacher.
I hate everyone.
I'm very disappointed in you.
I'll speak to him at the first opportunity.
Tom stood in the dark.
I am in trouble.
I used to worry about the difference in our ages.
Tom woke up at the crack of dawn.
You make me sick.
I'm not going to tell you her name.
Is it my turn?
Tom and Mary are in the audience.
I'm here to have fun.
The following day he was found dead in the bedroom.
Why do you need to read such a book?
I'm just trying to get to know you.
Rome was not built in a day.
Table manners vary from one country to another.
Can you please pour me some more wine?
Are you here with someone?
How weird!
Tom went to the same school that I did.
You've got a big hole in your sock.
What exactly are you afraid of?
I can still hear your voice.
Tom has high cheekbones.
He's accustomed to mountain climbing.
I used to drink beer.
Put yourself in my position.
He left the room.
I have so many things I want you to know.
Tom cleaned the garage all by himself.
People once mocked the idea that the earth is round.
Tom lives like a king.
Tom is after me.
Picasso painted this picture in 1950.
You're not going to understand it.
I didn't know Tom couldn't speak French.
I was in London last month.
The first stage is complete.
You hurt him.
I am reading a book.
The first thing you have to do is take a bath.
Tom knew almost everyone there.
Do you want to do it again?
That's a really shallow thing to say.
All the exams are now behind us.
Should we try it?
You're a coward.
We had a very good time at the dinner.
Tom is going be OK.
No place in the world is as beautiful as the Swiss Alps.
I never realized how much I'd miss you.
I thought you always played football on Saturday.
My brother is an engineer.
I have the same problem.
Nobody knows my country.
I spent the summer vacation at my aunt's house.
Tom had a plan.
I meant you no harm.
Why do you not like Tom?
We were so excited that we couldn't sit still.
Thank you for your attention.
It won't be easy.
He never wears a tie.
Why don't you tell me about it?
Tom is stunned.
It sure is windy today.
If you don't want to do this, you don't have to.
My vet recommended euthanizing my dog.
I'm sure that my daughter will pass the exam.
It just doesn't make sense.
Tom told me where you hid the gold coins.
Tom is probably going to be called as a witness.
Is that all you have to say to me?
She always dresses in black.
I like your garden and the flowers in it.
You are as white as a sheet.
He works in that lab.
Can't you just take my word for it?
What do you have in your pocket?
She worked from morning till night.
Do you want any of these flowers?
I'll do that.
Tom has terrible eyesight.
What wine goes well with Brie?
I made up my mind to study harder.
I was surprised, to say the least.
Don't go in my room.
Tom approved that.
Tom has been doing a pretty good job of eluding the police, but eventually he'll get caught.
She deposits 10,000 yen in the bank every month.
Tom looks like he's rich.
I'm not tired at all.
This statue is made of solid gold.
Science begins when you ask why and how.
Did you tell Tom that Mary did this?
Harvard University was founded in 1636.
I wonder if he will come.
He has money.
Good words are worth a lot, but cost almost nothing.
He asked me whether anybody was there.
I should go to Boston.
Stop complaining and do as you're told.
It was a busy night.
Could you put these in a box?
Leave my room immediately.
I thought you didn't believe in ghosts.
Get away!
Bring me my glasses.
What did you do at that moment?
A sleeping child looks like an angel.
She made the same mistake again.
OK, that's all for today.
I like to travel by myself.
The break is over.
I caught more fish than Tom did.
They need new shoes.
I hope you had a good night's sleep.
Did you remember to do what I asked you to do?
Tom has a scar on his face.
He's a cheat and a liar.
Listen! They're playing my favorite music.
Tom heard Mary crying.
I saw Tom doing it.
Your idea is similar to mine.
I don't know what's wrong with you today.
She laughed at the sight of his hat.
A guy named Tom was looking for you this morning.
They're normal kids.
It was really horrible.
I'll visit you sometime in the near future.
I'm healthy.
Every time I see this photo, I think of my father.
The teacher is fresh from college.
Where do you want to eat?
I can't draw, but my sister is a great artist.
I don't want to be friends with Tom.
I didn't want to get up early.
The floorboards creaked.
Tom said he wasn't in a hurry.
We're desperate to find a solution.
How did you come by such a large sum of money?
The teacher lined the children up in order of height.
The meal satisfied his hunger.
Sometimes you're so irritating.
Do you like going to school?
They all looked at Tom.
Tom didn't stir.
Tom said he didn't think that the cold bothered Mary.
When you cross the bridge, don't look down.
Maybe I'll come to Boston again next year at this time.
You're a good man.
I'm bald.
How big is Tom's house?
May I use this pen?
Tom can't remember exactly where he parked his car.
I want to have nothing to do with you.
I think we should keep an eye on Tom.
Tom isn't here now.
Where have you been? We were just about to call the police.
Is that fun?
My plane leaves at six o'clock.
Tom opened the door, expecting to see Mary.
I had a tennis match with him.
A driver was sleeping in the car.
We're good to go.
I didn't drink the milk.
The prisoners fled from the concentration camp.
You know what I think.
Next time, ask me before you use my car.
She caught a cold last night.
She didn't mind doing the dishes.
She wept the entire night.
It's cold, so I want to eat something hot.
Are you happy with how you look?
Can you believe it? He's even lazier than me.
I failed chemistry.
What's it to you?
Who cheated?
I'm very surprised that Tom isn't here.
Tom wants to be happy again.
Do you need help?
I was outdoors.
I'm interested in music.
Life begins when you are forty.
There was blood on Tom's pillow.
Tom likes carrots.
I just didn't want to take any chances.
He came here again.
I'm counting on you not to back out.
Tom left a gift for you.
She is pigeon-toed.
You have to eat regularly.
It was not until recently that she changed her mind.
Your work has greatly improved.
We agreed on 2:30.
I cannot thank you too much.
Almost every tourist carries a camera with him.
I'm looking for my hat.
He's not stupid.
I don't want to have kids, but I want to get married.
I was as cool as a cucumber.
It's nonsense to try that.
This doesn't look like yours.
More and more people offered to help.
It was Tom's idea to try it this way.
I remember the day when the accident happened.
We met at two in the afternoon.
Their names escaped me.
Be sensible.
The cat seems to want some water.
Tom and Mary were held as hostages for three months.
Why does no one believe me?
He reached for the pistol.
I noticed that she sat in the front row.
She is blackmailing him.
The world doesn't revolve around you.
He stuffed the money into his pocket.
That's really sweet.
What are you sorry about?
We have already finished our dinner.
She proceeded with the work.
Who took these pictures?
I'm not trying to make you feel guilty.
I'm over here.
Pass me the salt, would you?
It is exactly three o'clock now.
How do you spend your free time?
I'm getting the hang of this new machine.
Will you tell me the truth?
Because of the bad weather, the plane was delayed three hours.
Tom kicked Mary.
We have seen no one.
I will make up for the lost time by working as hard as I can.
They weren't warned of the tidal wave.
That's where you're wrong.
Tom has a drawer full of letters from Mary.
All babies cry.
She is a beauty, admittedly, but she has her faults.
I am concerned for her safety.
What do you plan to major in at college?
As far as I know, Tom is retired.
It's badly damaged.
Do you know where Tom is taking us?
We prefer to stay here.
I want kids.
Tom heard wolves howling.
What do you mean by that?
Tom relented.
She will give birth in July.
He liked making decisions.
How am I going to do that?
Children really like playing on the beach.
That had not occurred to him before.
Mary's baby was three weeks premature.
We all had the same idea.
He works as a ghost writer.
Are you hiding something from me?
What can you give me?
He is alone.
How do you come to school?
Tom has a scar on his cheek.
This does not apply to students.
Do you think that will change anything?
The garden has a wooden fence.
Tom misses his wife.
Tom certainly understands that we all need to attend today's meeting.
They're up to no good.
Tom decided to become a teacher.
I did exactly what you told me to do.
Just keep moving.
They're watching me.
She had never dreamed of meeting him abroad.
A problem shared is a problem halved.
I'm so ashamed.
In a word, life is short.
You should look up that word.
Where did you learn all this?
Nobody wants you to do this.
Tom told me you were upset.
Tom seldom wears a hat.
Have you seen my son?
I brought something that I want to give you.
Tom taught me how to cook.
I have no friends to play with.
I think it's time to try a new approach.
You haven't seen the last of me.
I'm still not happy with how things worked out.
How do you take your coffee?
The Americans had very little gunpowder.
You gain nothing by speaking ill of others.
It's an inside joke.
I went into the house.
I love trips.
I tried to persuade Tom to come to Boston with us, but he said he had other things he had to do.
I think my right arm is broken.
My French teacher is the same age as me.
He never laughs.
I admit to being careless.
When's the wedding?
Copy this, please.
If everyone agrees to it, I won't vote against it.
I often spend my free time listening to music.
It wouldn't hurt.
Tom remembered something.
It was too late for us to do anything else.
You're thirty thousand dollars in debt.
There is a toy shop in the neighborhood.
Tom felt Mary's forehead to see if she had a fever.
I'm buying a new car.
I would also like to rent a car.
I am totally confused.
We must prevent this type of incident from recurring.
Concentrate on what you're doing.
I am disappointed that my friend is not here.
Come and join us.
I'll be back at six-thirty.
The guests should be arriving soon.
Electronic components can be cleaned using pure isopropyl alcohol.
Have you ever tried telling a joke in French?
I'm not going to live here.
Tom revealed his secret to us.
Maybe that won't be necessary.
You've never been to Europe, have you?
Can you still remember when we first met?
Everybody knows his name.
Tom asked Mary some questions that she couldn't answer.
I can't get Tom out of the house.
They don't understand French.
To know oneself is not easy.
I visited Tom in Boston.
We have everything.
How do you feel?
Can I talk to someone who speaks French?
You were in danger.
You'd better let me do that.
There are as many as two hundred cherry trees in this park.
It'll cost about 2,000 yen to repair it.
Supplies of food were low and we had to ration out the little that was left.
Tom retired at 65.
Is your friend still sleeping?
I like fish.
That's really weird.
I care about that.
Graham Greene is my favorite author.
I see why Tom doesn't like you.
Tom took off his coat and gloves.
Tom and I ran.
I'm interested in doing that, but Tom isn't.
She's worried about your safety.
This book belongs to the school library.
Why is Tom dressed like that?
We need a little sugar.
We found it.
I won't answer questions.
It's time for you to get up.
Who does this suitcase belong to?
You're not dead.
Tom's explanation was too complicated.
Do you want me to help Tom?
I think Tom understood that.
This house is full of spider webs.
Do you really want to know what I think?
You aren't yourself today.
Tom can't put up with Mary's behavior anymore.
This desk was too heavy to lift.
I hardly see you anymore.
All you have to do is sit down here and answer the doctor's questions.
In spite of our encouragement, he decided to throw in the towel.
He is commander of our troops.
Let this smoky air out of the room and let some fresh air in.
Tom left the house without even saying goodbye.
I'd love to stay.
Come and look for yourself.
They pay Tom well.
I swear I didn't know Tom was coming.
I wonder why Tom came here today.
I'm sure Tom's fine.
I don't feel guilty about that.
I met him at a club.
We're hiding.
I want to have this letter translated into English by tomorrow.
You are richer than I am because your pay is double my pay.
What is the ultimate purpose of education?
Tom never used to eat so much junk food.
Did you find anything in the room?
You have to see it.
He did it for the money.
I will wait here until he comes back.
I'd like to check out.
When I was about to leave my house, I got a phone call from her.
I saw the boxing match on television.
I was told you were reliable.
You can use this car.
I sharpened a pencil with a knife.
Do you have time to help us tomorrow?
Are you on the committee?
I'd like to discuss some of my suggestions.
She bought him a dog.
I'm counting how many people there are.
The story is very interesting to me.
Tom wants to live in the country.
So the little boy put his hands in his pockets.
Tom shouldn't have written his password on the inside cover of his notebook.
I withdrew some money from the bank for my trip.
You should've told me earlier.
I wonder what that means.
I know where you can find Tom.
It's mine.
I have nothing else to do.
Tom offered me a cup of coffee.
Can I get a little help, please?
Did you forget to lock the door last night?
This is a picture.
I panicked and ran.
You can't see my house from here.
Tom's novel has been translated into French.
She was promoted.
He asked my mother.
What are your duties?
I started studying French when I was thirteen.
You sure eat a lot.
You have no idea how distressed she was.
It's a room large enough for a library.
Do you want me to pick you up at the airport?
He has 12 sons.
I only have three dollars on me.
Admission to the museum is thirty dollars.
His house is not far from here.
You should eat more vegetables.
Why don't you just apologize?
I love my son.
How did Tom get in here?
He just returned from abroad.
Tom doesn't feel like cooking.
Only Tom knows the truth.
He's going to love this.
What newspaper do you read?
Will you please call me this evening?
You said that last time.
Is this confusing?
That's what I say.
That's how it should be.
I was kind of surprised Tom said that.
What will happen will happen.
This room will soon heat up.
The rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer.
Let's get it done.
My car broke down on the way.
We made pancakes for breakfast.
I ran upstairs.
I'm not sure why you came here.
Tom knew I'd be there.
He has lost interest in politics.
Which party do you belong to?
You were our last hope.
We couldn't do anything for them.
Perhaps this is wrong.
She's smarter than Mary, but not as beautiful as Mary.
She begged him not to go there.
I thought you might like to know who's coming to our party.
I'll do nothing of the sort.
All right. Please order it.
Let me pay.
The president appointed a new manager.
Tom and Mary played miniature golf.
Tom didn't know the deadline was today.
Do you still drive a blue car?
It's hot today. The temperature is up to 45° C.
Please buy a few apples.
What's Tom doing here?
I'm sure this will happen again.
This camera is less expensive than that one.
Let me know your address.
He has absolute power.
We captured Tom.
It's almost October.
These are for you.
I'm looking forward to doing business with you.
Tom lacks motivation.
I came to see how you're doing.
What's up, dude?
At what hour was she born?
I'm not feeling very well.
Do as I say, not as I do.
Don't be worried.
You shouldn't try to do everything by yourself.
When did you first meet Tom?
Wait here until we get back.
I want to know about you.
This is perfectly legal.
Have you put up your Christmas tree already?
We turned left at the corner and drove north.
Take a look at this map.
Tom gets home every Monday at about 2:30.
I am afraid you have the wrong number.
This table isn't steady.
Tom has to come with me.
You ought to do it at once.
How do you know when you've found the right person for the job?
He is very careful.
I bought five ten-yen stamps.
What language do they speak in Egypt?
That's a safe bet.
Tom is suspicious of Europeans.
I promise you I'll help you.
Tom hasn't changed.
I think his suggestion is worth considering.
All of us are happy.
It is getting hotter day by day.
I'm an extremely humble person.
Time's up. Please pass in your exams.
Tom biked home.
Can I take a day off?
Forgive me for wasting your time.
There is nothing to apologize for.
Is everybody all right?
I will show you the picture.
She has just turned twenty.
She met him three years ago.
Can you get something to eat in there?
I don't poke my nose into other people's business.
Fresh vegetables contain many nutrients.
The three sisters look very much alike.
We like music.
Give me three pieces of salmon.
You'll find this map very useful.
Of all the houses we've looked at, this one is by far the best.
It looks like you're on your own.
That shouldn't be too hard.
Just get me the list.
Do you have time to help us tomorrow?
Was Tom crying?
If you leave now, you'll get there on time.
Are you trying to grow a beard?
He's got money to burn.
I imagine that Tom will eventually learn to deal with the way people treat him.
I ran into Tom the other day.
I learned how to ride a bike when I was six years old.
We can't afford to make any mistakes.
We've accomplished everything we set out to do.
There were no roses in the garden.
This book will be printed next year.
I know it's in the apartment, but I can't find it.
Look up the word in your dictionary.
We understand this.
She sang a Japanese song for us.
The plane crashed.
When I heard that, I put two and two together.
Tom was guilty.
I know what's right.
Tom asked Mary to call him after dinner.
What does your son want to be when he grows up?
I wish you good luck.
I thought you said you didn't see anything.
I'm going to do it again.
Your problem is similar to mine.
I think you'd like it in Boston.
Don't you have a pen?
I'd like to hear you sing.
I fell.
He acknowledged me by lifting his hat.
Tom contributed.
When will he come?
Tom knew nothing.
Tom has a pretty girlfriend.
You will fail unless you work harder.
You ought to have apologized to her.
I'm so confused.
Tom bought too much bread.
Tom's thirsty.
We had to learn the poem by heart.
Did it ever occur to you that I might want to stay in Boston for a few more days?
Why do you have to be like that?
I'm going to Boston on Monday.
How about having our lunch in the park?
I'll wait here till he comes back.
Tom and Mary usually speak to each other in French.
My aunt showed me how to make good coffee.
He regretted it afterwards.
She is beginning to play the piano.
That isn't fair.
I'm a city girl.
Eternity is a really long time.
Do you have any idea how dangerous that is?
Tom blocked my way.
He was sharpening a knife.
Tom needs hope.
We're decisive.
I'm not mad anymore.
They've never met.
I won't let you escape.
The manager complimented him on his achievement.
Don't go in my room.
I cannot help you.
Greece was the cradle of western civilization.
Tom's boat sank.
I know what you're trying to do.
I want to eat something that I can only eat here.
I've been doing it for years.
I already told you that she isn't here.
Tom had ambition.
How long does it take to learn to play the xylophone?
The hill on which my house stands commands a full view of the city.
Please don't be sad.
Why didn't you tell us you knew how to speak French?
Tom is too busy.
You go right ahead.
I wish you didn't have to leave.
I have a fish tank.
I don't know when Tom got married, but I do know he got married.
I promise I won't tell anyone where you are.
Where's your sister?
Divide the cake among the three of you.
I went to church every Sunday when I was a boy.
How long have you been waiting?
Are there any beaches in Germany?

Is that possible?
Did you do that purposely?
See you tomorrow at the library.

You're going with me, aren't you?

Where will you be on October 20th?
Tom was correct all along.
Have you paid your taxes?
I'd like to sleep a little longer.
Are my ears red?
Tom added his own name to the list of people who wanted to take part in the dance.
Does Tom know you're coming?
We get on OK.
What are friends for?
Just wait for us here.
Tom is thickheaded.
I can take you home now.
You haven't eaten anything.
He was loved by everybody.
My son can already count up to one hundred.
It's from your family.
When is Tom coming?
Tom and Mary are still watching TV.
She sometimes has her sister write her term papers.
Get out of my way.
Did you watch this movie?
How would you feel?
May I speak to you alone?
Tom held the gun to Mary's head.
I'll give Tom half of my share.
What's your favorite cartoon?
I don't know why Tom is so angry.
I should've run away.
Tom and Mary are now divorced.
Do you want another one of these?
Police officers wear blue uniforms.
Does Tom know how to do this?
We have experienced many changes over the last decade.

It doesn't mean anything!

She has very neat handwriting.
Smile at the camera, please!
I think this is a big mistake.
The money was all there. Nobody touched it.
I don't want to hear another complaint about you.
We need more people like you.

That was probably what influenced their decision.
He didn't know what to say.
Don't ever do this again.
Tom knows why Mary did that.
I wanted to know what happened.
I was accused of eating the boss's lunch.
We hugged each other.
My parents pushed me to quit the baseball club.
Thank you for seeing us.
I thought I'd gotten over you.
You're acting very strangely.
Don't let Tom help Mary.

The local train is less comfortable than the express train.
My wife isn't beautiful. Yours is.
Tom got up to a lot of mischief at school.
Smoking is not allowed here.
Tom pushed his plate away and said that he had eaten enough.
This meeting room is small.
Do you know what you're asking?
I'm patient.
Tom walked along the shore alone.
We should head home.
I remember seeing him once.
Can you supply me with all I need?
Don't go in.
Tom reminded his mother to wake him up at 6:30.
Let me handle Tom.
I have a sore throat.
You're impatient.
I like studying history.
I wish all my problems would go away.
She can't be over thirty.
Tom arrived home after dark.
Why didn't you tell me you were in love with Tom?
If you wish, you can go.
I'd like to get a second opinion.
I think this is yours.
Can't you talk any sense into Tom?
He fell head-long into the river.
The ship went up in flames.
Tom's boat sank.
I heard it from a reliable source.
Frankly speaking, he is wrong.
I wish you'd come sooner.
Tom likes Mary, but Mary likes John. To make matters even more interesting, John likes Alice, but Alice likes Tom.
It's almost time.
I feel a little weak today.
Those who know him like him.
I had little choice.
You never trusted me.
I've given up on the idea of buying a house.
Who's the new guy?
You don't know Tom like I do.
That's kind of you, Tom.
I chopped a tree down.
Why would I laugh?
Tom is tactless.
Why are people always so cynical?
Don't you dare touch that.
I haven't eaten anything in six days.
Her English is excellent.
I thought about smashing his guitar, but I didn't do it.
What would you change?
Both his grandfathers are dead.
He is the tallest person in the class.
Put it on.
My clock is five minutes fast.
Who do you think I am?
How many times a week do you study French?
He is a teacher.
I see that it is raining.
The first few years were difficult.
If you have a minute, you might want to read this.
He's been staying at that hotel for the past five days.
It would be better if you read more books.
Mother set the table for dinner.
Did you find your letters?
Tom surrendered.
I don't know what you mean.
He sat there smoking a pipe.
Sitting down all day and looking at a computer screen is bad for you.
It doesn't matter anyway.
I went to the airport to meet my father.
You can ski on that hill.
I have a lot of work to do tomorrow.
Wash your face and comb your hair.
You're going to be proud of me.
Has she finished the book yet?
I like Tom better than Mary.
Someone screamed.
Do you play a musical instrument?
It's pretty simple.
We really did try.
What's Tom good at?
What's the weirdest thing you've ever eaten?
Tom is acting strange.
I want to talk to you about something else.
When can I move in?
He went to Paris at the end of May.
I thought Tom would like to know.
Don't take any unnecessary risks.
Tom gave us some food.
Fry an egg for me.
The captain assured us that there would be no danger.
Tom didn't get very far.
So how did it go with Tom?
I'm not as fond of music as you are.
It must be wonderful to live here.
Tom told me I shouldn't talk to you.
They lost the battle.
She's been ill since last Wednesday.
You said that Tom wasn't hungry.
This room is comfortable.
This isn't supposed to be happening.
Tom is concerned.
Tom is thinking about it.
I demanded that he pay the debt back at once.
Why do you want to study abroad?
Have I forgotten anything?
I am greatly impressed.
Tom went to Boston to study music.
Do we really need it?
I'm not going to do that.
You are a good cook.
Why didn't you just leave?
Did he have sandwiches for lunch?
This store sells old books.
Don't throw that away.
Don't expect everyone to like you.
Some people think that the voting age should be lowered to 16.
They studied English yesterday.
Everybody is excited.

Someone is watching you.
The doctor advised me to drink more milk.
Many of the dogs are alive.
I saw the boat sink.
Leave me alone.
I plan on doing that by myself.
Where were you yesterday at 2:30?
What did you say that for?
It wouldn't be wise to do that.
I'm afraid of dying.
My income is twice as large as yours is.
He gave a vague answer.
Why can't I go?
I'll see you in court.
My TV broke, so I had to take it to get it repaired.
What were Tom and Mary supposed to do?
Tom almost forgot the conference.
Listening to this song makes me want to dance.
Didn't you read the sign?
I saw her at the station.
Do you want to work here?
Some people would question the truth of such rumors.
Is that how you do it?
It helps.
Tom started smiling.
Often, the less there is to justify a traditional custom the harder it is to get rid of it.
It's about time for him to get here.
The thief ran away.
She is very pretty.
Where's Daddy?
Tom told me I'm better at doing that than Mary.
Is it possible to be both happy and sad at the same time?
His parents expect too much of him.
I'll bring it to you tomorrow.
She stared at me.
I didn't understand what you said.
Tom left his textbook in the car.
What's your favorite shampoo?
I forget your phone number.
Do you eat rice every day?
Tom wanted to live on a farm.
What you are saying does not make sense.
I would often play tennis with him.
Every religion prohibits murder.
What is she like?
Why don't we take a taxi?
The secretary opened the mail which had been delivered that morning.
Let in some fresh air.
Tom is our friend.

How many people have you told?
I'll cook bacon and eggs.
You're wrong in this case.
My dream came true.
I was busy the whole day.
I lost a lot of blood.
Tom has been everywhere.
I'm pleased to hear that.
Raise your hand if you know the answer.
This tree was planted by my grandfather.
Visiting hours are almost over.
Did you read the ad Tom put in the paper?
You are not Japanese.
Tom is quite handsome, isn't he?
She was forced to confess.
He often goes to Japan on business.
What's so funny?
Without your advice, I would have been robbed of my bag.
How many boys are there in your class?
Are you going to be there?
You're prejudiced, aren't you?
Tom swims every day.
Her father is an excellent pianist.
Have you ever been betrayed by a good friend?
My girlfriend is Chinese.
You're not happy, are you?
Tom picked up the pieces of shattered glass.
Tom reached for the dictionary on the top shelf.
Put me in touch with her.
Mary got mad at me.
Tom wanted to know what Mary's last name was.
That name doesn't ring any bells.
Which cup is yours?
Nobody had an answer.
We'll never forget your kindness.
You know who I am, don't you?
He did it himself.
Why don't you shut up?
Tom and Mary were very quiet in the car.
He's a close friend of mine.
Did Tom already know that?
How come you didn't call me last night?
Tom was rescued by a passer-by.
Tom can't wait until next week.
Tom will probably leave next week.
In my opinion, a well-designed website shouldn't require horizontal scrolling.
What he says is total nonsense.
What're you going to do during your summer vacation?
You lost.
Have you learned nothing from your mistakes?
The universe was born more than 12 billion years ago.
This ticket is valid for two days after purchase.
Is Tom alone now?
They leaned out of the window to watch the parade.
She threatened to tell on me.
This price is too high.
He has learned to be patient.
Keep on working.
This is your chance, Tom.
Neither of us can speak French.
Will you drink another cup of coffee?
You weren't even there.
You won't find anyone who'll do that for you.
Oh, come on.
Tom is going to go to Boston by car.
I'd like to meet Tom as soon as possible.
It isn't possible to leave this island.
He's the black sheep of the family.
I need to remember to buy some milk.
We recognized it from your description.
As soon as Tom finished work, he went home.
Everyone makes mistakes from time to time.
That was a really stupid thing to do.
Aren't you from Boston, too?
Tom broke his right arm.
Tom didn't want to talk with Mary.
Tom asked Mary to leave the windows open.
Take my advice!
Do you speak Albanian?
There are 31 days in December.
Come aboard.

No one's going to see me.
It looks good on you.
The towel is wet.
When exactly did you get here?
He has a small advantage.
I'm beginning to regret it.
I don't feel up to seeing your mother today.
I'll go look for Tom.
Tom isn't coming home with us.
Let me know when you need me again.
If you have a problem with that, talk to the boss.
Freeze!
I like to walk.
It would be better for you to stay in bed today.
Her cooking is the best.
Did you bring a hair dryer?
What you have said applies only to single women.

Do you have any pets?
She's a very interesting person.
I'm sure Mom will get mad.
Tom didn't quite know what Mary meant.
He gave up his life for his country.
They say that old house is haunted.
Plants require CO2 to grow.
How far is it from Boston to Chicago?
What does the Bible say about this?
Be proud of yourself.
Please leave a message.
My brother is an idiot.
There were at least 100 people present.
I already told you that a hundred times.
Not everyone is happy about this.
He reluctantly went to see her.
Tighten the strap around the suitcase.
I no longer live here.
I don't think you tried hard enough.
Summer is over.
I'll be ready in a jiffy.
Tom stayed in bed all day watching TV.
You should eat something.
I don't like scary movies.
You don't have to lie.
They both blushed.
Thanks for coming with me.
He never laughs at my jokes.
Tom was my only friend at that time.
He is a scientist.
We'd like to ask you a few questions.

I'll get by.
Will this do?
Tom was speaking to some neighbors.
You don't have to shout. I can hear you.
I think you're going to like Tom.

I want you to help me clean it up.
Tom wants to finish doing what he's doing before he goes home.
You'll regret it someday.
My uncle lives in New York.
Tom is too old for you.
He is always cheerful.
I'd just like to talk.
Do you have any news?
He continued the experiment.
Doing that should be possible.
There was no response to my question.
I just want to let you know that I won't let you down.
I dream of seeing him there.
I saw your light was on and knew you were still awake.
I can't make it to the hospital without some help.
Get into the car and wait for me.
Won't you come in and have a cup of tea?

The enemy is weak.
I don't feel like going out these days.

How did you make a living in Tokyo?
Where am I going to go?

That was a good decision.
There was a long winter before them.
Whenever I see this, I remember him.
I thought that was the case.
It's better that way.
Everyone, including Tom, was sitting around the table.
Mary showed the letter to me.
We make butter from milk.
We were dead tired from the five-hour trip.
Do you remember when I saw you last?

I don't think Tom will be here on time.
Tom drives a Toyota.
Tom heard Mary yelling at John.
What a big truck!

The girls won.
Whatever you do, don't let go of the rope.
I have to get back to work.

I told Tom to stay.
He likes all animals except horses.
I believed every word he said.
Shoot anything that moves.
I'm leaving it to you.
He was the first man I interviewed for the job.
We're having a lot of fun.
She could die.
That's what Tom thinks.

He resembles his grandfather.
Tom is about to do that.
Do you let your children play in the street?
That's up to Tom.
I want to become a better teacher.
The first lesson is easy.
The baseball team is certain to win the next game.
Nobody can foresee what'll happen.
Did you receive the flowers?
Stay cool.
Roll the dice.
The vacation came to an end all too soon.
I was looking for you.
I don't understand what the problem is.
I think no one knows.

I can always take the bus back to Boston, right?
I don't want to hear any of your complaints.

The plate is dirty.
You went to the park yesterday, didn't you?
There's a church behind my house.
You are not welcome in my home anymore.
China is bigger than Japan.
The plan is well worth trying.
Tom had no plan at all.
They live near the beach.
Three children are playing in the park.
I know I'm not welcome here.
They tried to swim to safety.
Hearing about people kidnapping little children just makes my blood boil.
I think you are mistaken.
I will never change my mind.
Some people like classical music, while others like popular music.
We must not be late.
Get serious.
The astronauts were greeted with spontaneous applause.
Tom and Mary aren't happy.
How long have you been dating?
Tom didn't want to marry the farmer's daughter.
The group put up posters to remind people that noise is harmful.
I miss my mom and dad.
Tom never cheats.
I had never been kissed before.
We often send each other pictures.
The situation is hopeless.
What would you do if you had great wealth?
It couldn't have come at a worse time.
You'll learn how to do it sooner or later.
I can't talk you into coming with us, can I?
I'm aware you've already finished.
You aren't making sense.
Tom put a hot water bottle on Mary's forehead.
I don't want to have any secrets from you.
Your daughter isn't a girl anymore.
Tom is three years younger than Mary.
I only did my duty.
I think it's time for me to sharpen my pencil.
Tom still lives at home.
Finally, I found a job.
What does Tom have to do?
I'm looking for my boots.
I know they're in love with each other.
If the food's cold, put it in the microwave.
Your team is better than ours.
Tom told everyone that he was afraid to do that.
I'm safe here.
Tom and Mary made their way through the crowd.
I'll always remember your kindness.
Tom didn't think he was committing a crime.
Tom arrived at 2:30 and Mary arrived a short time later.
They must work 8 hours a day.
She's being nice to me.
It is difficult to shoot a bird flying in the air.
Did you sue Tom?
Tom spoke loud enough for everyone to hear.
Tom was cheering.
He doesn't eat anything except fruit.
I don't have the faintest idea.
I'll get used to it sooner or later.
What kind of flowers do you like?
This town is quite different from what it was ten years ago.
Tom tried not to panic.
Do you think our climate has an influence on our character?
I want Tom to live.
Why did you bring it?
Where did they learn this?
Tom said that he wasn't living in Boston anymore.
I thought I'd never hear from you again.
Don't look at me like that.
I was worried about you all day.
Let's go to my place.
Do you know where he went?
Do you have a plan?
How do we look?
Tom is paid double time on Sundays and public holidays.
Is this the girl you spoke well of the other day?
Mary was desperate to get married.
I thought you were planning to be here early.
Do your homework now.
Tom believed the story that Mary told him.
Tom slept on the floor that night.
Are all the doors locked?
You just can't get good help these days.
I want to talk to you about something.
If I had a choice, I'd go home now.
Why did you invite Tom to the party?
Keep your hands off my bike!
Do you take work home with you?
She explained to him why she was late for his party.
Is one thousand yen enough?
We are in Paris.
I'm afraid it will rain.
Tom hasn't shaved since last Monday.
We spent our holiday at the seaside.
The two women look at Tom and then at each other.
He took a key from his coat pocket.
He regrets not having worked harder at school.
Are you planning on buying a car?
He cut the apple in half.
I like to do my homework.
I usually buy my clothes at the department store.
He caught three fish.
What products are currently on sale?
He runs the business with his sons.
He left for England at the beginning of August.
Long story short, I was fired.
That's the worst joke I've ever heard.
Be sure to lock the door before you go to bed.
Do you live around here?
I've seen Tom.
Tom doesn't like eating vegetables.
Tom knows that Mary doesn't speak French.
Guess what Tom said.
Seeing that it is raining, you had better stay home.
I don't get bored alone at home.
Maybe you should turn off the television and do something else.
The coat is lined with fur.
It was impossible for the boy to swim across that river.
I'll keep my fingers crossed that everything will go well for you today.
Tom isn't so gullible.
Tom glanced at his watch.
This is very easy.
Would you like to have dinner with me?
He looked very happy.
I feel like crying now.
Birds make their nests in trees.
It was really sweet.
How do you know I don't know?
Tom is in his thirties.
I like disco music.
I need a box of nails.
What was left?
You won.
He gave his camera to his friend.
Why are you singing here?
Do you know what color she likes?
Tom held the door open for Mary.
Tom was fired.
I have a backache.
Did you buy it on the black market?
What is it you're afraid of?
I think Tom wants me to do that.
The sole survivor of the crash was a baby.
I know where to look.
Everything was lost.
It's going to stay that way.
Tom and Mary were seated next to each other in the back seat of John's car.
Do you live there?
Take a break, Tom.
I like your earrings.
I'll ask when the train will get in.
Does Tom know why you don't like him?
Tom is shocked.

The apartment was furnished in the Victorian style.
Tom asked Mary when she was going to buy a new pair of shoes for her youngest daughter.
Tom dug a hole in the backyard.
I demand that he be punished.
Do you have any idea why that might be?
The new houses are of a uniform height.
The American troops held their ground.
Tom isn't familiar with that subject.
Tom wanted to talk with you.
Would you mind telling me what you're waiting for?
I'll phone you when I arrive.
It has been snowing on and off.
I'm much heavier than you.
I tried to tell Tom, but he refused to listen.
I'm sorry to have disturbed you.
I think that's where Tom is now.
I wouldn't sell that at any price.
Our new head office is in Tokyo.
I have good reasons for hating Tom.
Are you here alone?
That's a tall order.
Yesterday, my wheelbarrow was stolen.
I am very sorry for what I said.
The man wore a gun on his hip.
They talked about it on the telephone.
I want Tom to wash the car.
Tom's innocent.
Tom is just adorable.
We love our customers.
She earns a living by selling her paintings.
Take mine.
What time tomorrow morning would you like me to pick you up?

I don't understand that.
This is an old Scottish song.
I'll show you.
I'm a bit tired.
Have you ever stepped on a tomato?
Is the patient prepared for surgery?
Tom is up to no good.
This temple dates back to 780.
Get back to the ship.
I have very few really close friends.
I can't remember the melody of that song.
This doesn't involve you.
See you tomorrow at the library.
Are you polite?
I don't understand why Tom has to do that.
If you count the baby, then there are four of us.
Tom makes more money than his parents.
Can you solve this problem?
What do you say to taking a break?
Tom never said anything about the accident.
Tom saw something behind Mary.
Tom got used to ignoring the noise.
Tom misunderstood.
The girl who works at that bakery is cute.
He is good at playing tennis.
When did you begin learning French?
We are good friends.
I've always wanted to visit another country.
We took the enemy by surprise.
I have no time to see you.
Tom didn't notice the look of disdain on Mary's face.
The tactic worked.
I think Tom will win.
The young girl was in the next room playing with a doll.
Where's your favorite place to go when you want to be alone?
We got into a car.
The room was illuminated with red lights.
Tom took a short cut.
We flew from New York to St. Louis by way of Chicago.
How high is Mt. Fuji?
Tom kept texting.
We need to act fast.

I know what Tom is planning.

Don't be insulted.
No students could answer the question.
Where's the nearest bus stop?
The young adapt to change easily.
I feed my dog once a day.
I regret what happened yesterday.
You are my best friend.
Tom leafed through the magazine that was on the coffee table.
I was surprised Tom didn't come yesterday.
I swim every day.
Tom says hello.
It's already happening.
Call home!
I want you to do this.
Tom sat next to me in church.
What did Tom have to do with it?
Do you remember when you last saw Tom?
What makes you think I'll like it?
What's the matter? Just tell me.
Tom didn't mean to disappoint Mary.
The boy who's swimming over there with Mary is my younger brother.
I don't think I can apply for a job anywhere. I'm too old.
He spoke very well.
Tom sometimes visits me.
Is that from a book?
I study Korean.
Where does Tom go from here?
I exchanged yen for dollars.
Why isn't Tom sleeping?
She is anything but a singer.
Isn't that how competition works?
She doesn't seem to know what to do with her leisure time.
Perhaps Tom doesn't play the saxophone anymore.
Do you want to see this?
I miss my parents so much.
Have you ever noticed that Tom's right ear is much larger than his left ear?
Beat it.
Your reputation is good.
Tom helped Mary yesterday afternoon.
I won't let you go alone.
I can't go back in there.
I can't fit into those clothes anymore.
I thought Tom was joking.
What is the most popular movie now?
Tom made himself as comfortable as possible.
I'll show you the car I've just bought.
Tom is not as good-looking as Mary.
It all makes sense now.
Why are you staring at me like that?
Hey, what are you two up to?
This camera is small, but very good.
Didn't you just repair that three days ago?
If you mix blue and red, the result is purple.
I'm waiting for the right man.
I wasn't at home then.
When are you going?
The earth is different from the other planets in that it has water.
We have to have this.
The brake didn't work.
I knew you'd like it.
Nothing can be done.
Tom heard a strange noise.
It could be big trouble.
I hope you and Tom have a good time.
Who invited you to the party?
Do you have this shirt in black?
Tom might've died.
Nothing has been heard from him since he left for America.
Mail this letter.
Do not try to imitate her.
The mail arrives before noon.
Tom does like you.
I'll see him again.
I'm going to miss your cooking.
I hope it's not true.
I dropped my keys.
Tom is a World War II veteran.
Tom and Mary were discussing the pros and cons of raising the minimum wage.
Why did you get so angry?
You have to let me help you.
Tom might want to eat something when he finishes working out.
I'm going to see Tom.
It serves you right.
I think I've figured out how to fix this.
"Now and then I think of divorcing him." "You must be kidding!"
Tom can't get the bottle open. Could you help him?

Stay out of this.
Money changes people.

Give him the benefit of the doubt.

Please help yourself to the cookies.
I had a terrible dream.
I think I'm starting to get the hang of it.
Tom lost.
He doesn't know what he's supposed to do.
Tom had a beer.
They bought a new car.
My vet told me to feed my dog in the evening.
No one knew that.
He did not get up early.
Your order has been carried out.
Did you say yes?
Tom doesn't have the time to help Mary right now.
Keep on smiling.
Death is the fate of all people.
Tom was sleeping peacefully.
These boys ought to be sent to a reform school.
I bought it yesterday.
The table is green.
Blue looks good on you.
That sounds fair.
Generally speaking, New Zealanders are taller than Japanese.
We need this report by tomorrow.
I hate it when you're right.

Tokyo is larger than any other city in Japan.
Why is it there?
The bathtub needs to be cleaned.
Tom could help you.
I've done what you wanted.
No one had the heart to say he was wrong.
God knows that it is true.
Tom has shoulder-length hair dyed red.
Thanks in advance.
Tom honked the horn.
That is the sort of job I am cut out for.
I don't know why Tom is here.
When we started out in 2008, we wrote down a list of people that we wanted to hire, then went out and hired them.
She smiled.
You look very dignified.
Why don't we try doing this again tomorrow?
Tom hardly ever asks questions.
What I need is not money, but your advice.
The radius of the Earth is 6400 km.
It looks like your luggage is on the next flight.
What do you think is going to happen?
What do you need that for?
Tom has been asking to see you.
She cooks well.
Tom was screaming.
We are happy to see you.
Tom and Mary are holding hands.
You know Tom has a thing for you.
Was that you in the car?
Leave the matter to me.
Tom's hope was to win first prize.
Tom looked through the peephole.
How about you?
Do you have any more questions?
What would you do if the world were to come to an end tomorrow?
It's difficult to find one's way around in a strange city.
I hope I can be of some help to you.
She got off the bus and ran towards him.
I don't understand German at all.
It is expensive to live in Japan.
Mary began to shiver in her thin blouse.
He gave me this book.
You don't seem too enthusiastic.
Is Germany near Italy?
Please don't pry into my personal affairs.
I can't lend you money, because I don't have any myself.
Tom sounds worried.
Don't be crazy.
I want to be a teacher when I grow up.
Does Tom want me to help him?
She was naive.
He kept talking.
Did you go to the last class?
I should not have said that.
It seems that she was ill.
Tom outsmarted me.
Exceptions prove the rule.
Tom needs to do that every morning.
We need to talk about something.
Tom saw him.
Many high-level officials attended the meeting.
I want you to go to Osaka at once.
No one can predict where lightning will strike.
Who's that for?
She's used to getting up early.
Let's see it.
You haven't seen the last of me.
Tom was the only one in the house.
They admire each other.
I remember the day Tom broke his leg.
The suitcase contained nothing but dirty clothes.
You can come with us.
I expected better from you.
I fail to understand what the problem is.
Something unexpected happened.
The children are playing hide-and-seek.
Tom is distressed.
Take this medicine between meals.
You are sure to succeed, whatever you do.
Tom thought that he had woken up from his dream, but in fact he was still dreaming.
Tom realized he'd said way too much.
I wonder what has become of him.
I miss you.
Tom is no hero.
She seems to be in love with my brother.
Of course, I will go there with you.
Your father seems very nice.
Do you know what Tom looks like?
The weather was getting worse and worse.
She used to pray before going to bed.
Tom says he's unsure.
He is known to the entire country.
Speaking of hobbies, do you collect stamps?
Tom didn't play basketball.
She blamed her failure on bad luck.
I'm not certain, but I think so.
Tom has to be more careful.
The box is covered with a large sheet of paper.
I had a toothache yesterday.
Rabbits have long ears.
I think it's highly unlikely that Tom was not aware that he wouldn't be allowed to enter the museum without his parents.
The island is nearly a mile across.
I know what Tom is looking for.
I am losing my patience with you.
We've lost contact.
She accompanied him on the piano.
Is it important?
I have to pay the bill.
Tom massaged my temples with his fingers.
Don't underestimate the power of your imagination.
Did you visit the Tower of London?
I wish I could figure out how to convince Tom to stay.
Come on. Let's go home.
When it rains, she takes the bus.
Tom knew he didn't have enough money.
I just wanted to say good luck.
Do you watch TV every day?
I came here to see Tom.
I don't know what's wrong with Tom.
These trousers are too large.
Why don't you try on this yellow sweater?
I've been told to help you.
Those who enforce the law must obey the law.
No one could see us.
He hasn't done anything.
In that respect, my opinion differs from yours.

I thought you'd quit smoking.
She swam fast enough to win a medal.
I'm dead serious.
Tom is sure that he'll be able to pass the test.
Tom told me someone was trying to kill him.
This word comes from Greek.
I've had a scratchy throat since this morning. I wonder if I've caught a cold.
Don't you want Tom to do that for you?
How did you arrive at that conclusion?
What were you doing out here?
I'm not interested in hearing any of your theories.
I'm not going to be very happy.
No matter what you say, I am convinced that I am right.
Take this medicine, and you'll feel better.
They are both very competent judges.
I like walking, especially in the morning.

Go find someone else to play with.
We chopped our way through the jungle.
He also speaks French.
Tom looks older than he really is.
Does Tom like Boston?
Where do you think Tom is going to live?
I didn't get it right.
I'll have something for you soon.
Don't waste too much time.
I'm taking off now.
Unfortunately, she lives abroad.
Nobody wants to do that.
Just go to your room.
Look at this.
She owns a very big house.
Tom rarely snores.
Kids are cruel.
Tom isn't himself today.

I assume you're willing to take the risk.
I'm not good with names.
I want something to drink.
The picture is in black and white.
Tom suggested it.
Tom approves.
She boiled the eggs.
You need to mind your own business.
Why don't we call it a day?
The surgeon took out his patient's appendix.
I'll pay you at the end of the month.
These days I'm very busy.
Tom wasn't eating.
Do you think Tom and Mary go to the same school?
Where can we meet?
Tom grabbed Mary by the throat and choked her.
My life is falling apart.
Have you forgiven Tom?
Your help will save us a lot of work.
I am disappointed.
You're right in a sense.
Tom needs you in the briefing room.
I arrived later than usual.
I've given up on you.
We were very impressed by his new book.

I went to Europe by way of America.
Whose turn is it to pay?
What's your feeling about the idea?
You simply don't understand.
Tom accidentally shot himself in the foot.
You're really a nice person.
This is not enough.
If you want something to be done right, sometimes you've just got to do it yourself.
This is wrong.
That's only my personal opinion.
Sorry. I didn't mean it like that.
A cat can see in the dark.
You have to believe me.
Can Tom do that?
How long do I have to stay?

You have changed since I saw you last year.
Did you see anybody there?
Tom said that he had a bad headache and needed to lie down.
Tom couldn't have done what you say he did.
Tom just glared.
Doesn't Tom ever wear a watch?
What you want is the most important thing.
We were all wondering why you were late.
Tom woke up a little before noon.
Tom is not far off the mark.
I can't do that to Tom.
Bring me the magazines.
I don't think it's Tom's fault.
Tom saw it, too.
He begged us to go with him.
She has very short hair.
Someday your dream will come true.
Tom warned me about you.
The man I saw yesterday was a complete gentleman.
It's Tom's profile.

I eat everything.
That's how we do it in Boston.
The pleasure's all mine.
I don't regret quitting my job.
I don't know if he's a doctor.
Why don't you just go home?
She can't cook well.
What does Tom think about all this?
Are you still mad?
It's entirely my fault.
She runs fastest in our class.
My teacher guided me in the choice of a career.
I should've been asked first.
Tom's the kind of person who calls a spade a spade and a lot of people don't like that.

How many photos are in this album?
You scared the living day lights out of me!
Tom and Mary don't want that.
This is what Tom feared.

Opposites attract.
I should make a complaint.
Tom felt foolish.
Do you know what I mean?
Mother and I were in the garden.
Almost no one believed her.
I didn't want to die.
What makes you think I like you?
Tom is going to show us the documents this afternoon.
I know what you did in Australia.

We partied all night long.
Way to go, Tom!

Give me half of it.
I don't have time for a vacation this year.
He explained to Mary why he was late for her birthday party.
Please keep this news to yourself for a while.
I assure you I'm in perfect health.
It doesn't matter what we do.
Everything went black.
He no longer lives here.
You've been deceived.
Tom arrived too early and Mary wasn't ready yet.
He likes singing.
Let's open the wine.
I made a nightmarish mistake.
She asked him to marry her.
Tom waited for more than an hour.
Tom looked at me like I was crazy.
The dog likes you.

The student raised his hand.
She was so angry that she could not speak.
Would you mind telling me what you're doing in my apartment?
Tom is better off than he was this time last year.
We will respect your wishes.
Welcome to our home.
You have to help us.
What he did was wrong.
You're right, as always.
Tom must've been a great teacher.
I'll call you in a week.
We're talking about what to do about what happened a couple of days ago.
This egg is fresh.
There are five pencils here.
Why don't you ask Tom yourself?
This desk is different from the one I ordered.
Tom could come with me if he wants to.
We were incorrect.
Do you want to see more?
I repair computers almost every day.
She doesn't know what she really wants.
Get away!
She screamed when she saw the snake.
I've got to get Tom to the hospital.

Where's my hat?
I paid him on the spot for his work.
I'll never forget him as long as I live.
I work here.
He came in and immediately sat down.
I just gave up.
I have to see this.
I remember it all.
He must have left the water running.
My TV is broken.
Which way is Tom's room?
"Do you love me?" "I don't know."
Come and see me once in a while.
Can you wait here until I get back?
I loved that house.
Take a walk.
Is this your car?
I don't snore.
Tom carried the chairs to the next room.
Don't compare yourself with your brother because he's a better man than you.
People might think you're stupid if you do that.
She's in danger.
That's all for today.
Tom pinched me.
All of the children had gone to bed before it got dark.
Tom seems like a very capable man.
Tom thought he was better at French than he really was.
It was wise of you to ask him for help.

I want to go to America someday.
When do you usually eat lunch?
Tom was genuinely happy to see Mary.

I was just having a little fun.
In his opinion, the plan is far from perfect.
Tom dealt five cards to each player.
Let's get this over with as fast as we can.

Who bought you this dress?
I forgot my password.
I can recommend a good lawyer.
Yours is over there.
You're not a morning person, are you?
Tom isn't in prison anymore.
Things change.
The others laughed.
I know what you thought.
Don't do anything silly.
I'd like to look inside.
All the stores were closed.
Tom says I'm a good listener.
It is a pity that you cannot travel with us.
Repetition is the mother of learning.
Do you like this garden?
I didn't lie to you.
Why are you so upset?

The door is opening now.
I don't want to work at a supermarket all my life.

We have a lot of work to do today.
What sort of jewelry are you going to wear with this dress?
I wonder where he is hiding.
You'll understand why one of these days.
He fixed the broken table.
You can't blame all your bad luck on Tom.
The Jacksons are going with us.
That is my overcoat.
We were never to see her again.
He spoke very loudly.
I thought I could do it without anybody's help.
I can't afford to rent a house like this in Tokyo.

I admire your optimism.

The cat chased the mouse, but couldn't catch it.
If you had stuck around, you would have had a lot of fun.

I hope you are not catching a cold.
We can't fail again.
You don't seem to be enjoying yourself.
I know who lives in this house.
I'm not going to stop.
What kind of books do you like to read?
I compared my car with his.
No one responded.
I'm undecided as of yet.
You should've told me the truth.
Do you really want a job in the same office as Tom?
I cannot stop her.
Could you possibly translate this for me?
Tom totally freaked out.
What're you doing in Boston?
I think I know you.

Tom didn't even ask me about it.
Try thinking about something else.
Tom started reading.
Nobody remembers.

This can is leaking.
Can you please tell me what's happening?
He is a rude person.

I know that Tom loves you.
Whose bicycle is that?
Hardly anyone ever comes to visit me.
That's what I'm talking about.

He can't take his eyes off her.
Don't you want to say goodbye to Tom?
Tom knows Mary's dog's name.
How long have you owned it?
Did you see yesterday's episode?
I like both.
Tom already understands that.
You should probably tell Tom you don't want to do that.
They are facing financial problems.
She's been living for the last five years under an assumed name.
I'll come back on the tenth.
I think you're trying too hard.
Do you really want to wait till Tom shows up?

Tom was married to Mary.
I can't say I'm surprised.
I don't even vote.
Tom saw his parents arguing.
Speak softly.
A trip to America is out of the question.
I went to the beach yesterday.
I thought it was the right thing to do.
Everyone was wearing headphones.
Tom saw someone.
Where are you planning to spend the night?
You're the same age as my son.
The police officer's partner was shot.
You must be crazy.
I had better ask them.
Let's meet in the lobby of the Imperial Hotel at 6:30 p.m.
Nobody wants you to do that.
Is that a crime?
When did you change your address?
Tom wasn't sleepy.
She's in the restroom.
I love you just as you are.
They don't always obey their parents.
Does that make you happy?
Are you going to be long?
They sell meat at this store.
Can I give you some friendly advice?
Do you always get up before six?
Let go of Tom.
Do you sell batteries?
I'm married now.
He made no response.
Tom says he doesn't think it'll be possible to do that.
It looks like Tom likes his new job.
I'm used to no one liking me.
This fish is delicious.
Tom thought that Mary was a genius.
Tom kissed Mary while John and Alice were looking the other way.
She gave me a present.
I think Tom already knows why Mary needed to do that.
Tom doesn't drink much beer, but he sure drinks a lot of wine.
You can't drive now. You've been drinking.
I take it back.
That's very naughty of you.
Is it true that you brought your dog to the office?
Tom doesn't like you very much either.
You will be welcome at any time.
The people stood up and began to sing.
What's your favorite time waster?
The flowers will brighten up the table.
Unbelievable!
Please mail this letter for me.
I'll look into that.
We are going to check it right away.
Can you recommend a good book?
It's been three days.
How about a cup of hot coffee?
Please find a solution to the problem.
These are my books, and those are his books.
Tom will manage.
Tom doesn't need money to have a good time.
I can only tell you what I know.
The dress Mary was wearing was white.
Are you in a bad mood?
I want you to call it off.
Tom told me he wanted to meet my parents.
What changes the world is communication, not information.
I guess we could.
Don't pretend what you don't feel.
I'll take this umbrella.
This is the same hospital where Tom works.
When Tom lost his job, he couldn't keep up his mortgage repayments and he was threatened with foreclosure.
This area is off-limits.
I hope so.
I have to explain this to Tom.
You don't recognize me, do you?
The ice is two inches thick.
We're planning to do just that.
Could you please wait a minute?
Thank you for your present.
You're a wonderful friend.
Yesterday, I met one of my former teachers.
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.
Tom is different.
Where did you have your suit made?
Tom wants to know when Mary will go shopping.
People keep saying that she's beautiful, but really, she isn't.
I've thought of that.
Does it matter to you what time we arrive?
Tom, can I have a moment with you alone?
We heard the church bells.
Is that what people do?
It would take forever for me to explain everything.
The river which flows through London is called the Thames.
This was a premeditated crime.
We got up early in order to see the sunrise.
We learn a good deal at school.
I can't face Tom now.
The two of us are finally alone.
Tom isn't interested in art at all.
I think Tom was lying to me.
She rents the room to a student for seventy thousand yen a month.
There are all kinds of flowers in that garden.
When are you coming to Melbourne again?
Don't rely too much on others.
If you want to, we'll go.
Could you please tell Tom that I need his help?
Have you measured it?
Tom wasn't looking at Mary, but he was listening to everything she was saying.
Be quick, or you will miss the train.
Tom was bluffing.
I want to know why you're doing this.
You're not coming, are you?
I don't want to live with you.
Tom may not be able to come.
Let's not play.
I didn't really want to do that.
Tom helped Mary to her feet.
Tom is impolite.
Barely a third of the population in this country have access to the Internet.
Do you think we will get there on time?
How did your meeting with Tom go?
I don't want to study today.
Tom wouldn't let me leave.
You're not allowed to park around here.
There's no such thing as luck.
Tom seems to have won.
Tom waved to everyone he saw.
Where did you take your gloves off?
I'm on my own.
I have a boyfriend who loves me.
Would you like to exchange links?
Are you watching it?
Hundreds of trees in this park blew over in the hurricane.
Aren't you hungry?
Tom just kept swimming.
I heard someone scream.
How long does Tom have?
My sister works as a secretary in a big multinational.
You love this car, don't you?
I only want to help you.
We can't let Tom die.
I don't want to play checkers.
Don't you have any ambition?
Tom got hit by a car.
Tom asked Mary why she was late.
The longer I waited, the more impatient I became.
His face was twisted with pain.
There is one apple on the desk.
I'm not sure of anything.
You asked us to do that.
I thank you for the warning.
It's hot today.
He began to feel ill.
I think Tom is expecting us both.
My birthday is in November.
Tom doesn't need to protect Mary anymore.
I spent a couple of months in Australia.
Since my mother was sick, I couldn't go there.
I want to hear you say it.
Tom had his wallet stolen on the train.
He doesn't love his girlfriend.
Don't worry. I'll take care of that.
He did well in all subjects and, above all, in mathematics.
Tom was surprised by how well Mary spoke French.
What was left?
Have you ever eaten Japanese food?

My brother seldom, if ever, goes to church.
I lost the watch that my father gave me.
It's time to come home.
Your English is grammatically correct, but sometimes what you say just doesn't sound like what a native speaker would say.
Where can I meet Tom?
I have no idea how he escaped.
I watched a movie on video.
I remember the words to the song, but I can't remember the melody.
There are a number of places to see in this city.
It may be all right.
I don't think there's any need for Tom to attend the meeting.
Do you have rice?
Tom disagreed with Mary on that point.
No less than three hundred dollars was needed for the work.
I want you to be mine forever.
Tom has already eaten dinner.
Tom denied the accusation.
Tom tried to call Mary numerous times.
Can you imagine that?
There are many books in my room.
We were looking for buried treasure.
I love comedies.
Why did you bring it?
He's in big trouble.
I'm used to getting more sleep.
My grandmother raised a family of ten.
Tom's room wasn't clean.
Tom and I have both been to Boston.

Adjust the focus of the microscope.
Tom has no right to give me orders.
I'm going to sell my house.
You should know that's impossible.
Where is Paris?
All Tom told me was that he wouldn't be at the meeting.
They burned.
The bookstore is open.
He easily gets angry.
You can rest.
You look very dignified.
It's your turn.
She fell asleep in my arms.
Tom hates jogging.
Will you take care of the children while I'm out?
He confirmed that it was the wreck of the Titanic.
Tom is checking his mailbox.
Neither of those books is interesting.
The car battery is dead.
It's the only possible conclusion.
Did you buy a new car?
The calculator on the table is mine.
No one has the right to treat you like this.
Tom committed crimes, but was never convicted.
They gave their horses water.
At any rate, the program was a success.
This is the very video I have been looking for.
No one lives in this house anymore.
This is not my day.
You should prepare for the worst.
Isn't the answer easy?
We killed time playing cards.
Are you saying you don't want to go?
He will be here any moment.
I found the cage empty.
Shouldn't we be doing something to help Tom?
Tom speaks French with an accent.
He thought that he was a genius.
I never wanted to deceive you.
You've got to stop, Tom.
I'll take this to Tom.
Look into the matter more carefully.
Would you tell me when to get off?
The coat is lined with fur.
Tom began to move.
This river is one mile across.
A fire broke out on the second floor.
It was not until the baby was fed that he stopped crying.

Loosen up.
I didn't receive your letter until today.
Everything matters.
Do you want another one of these?
We began to laugh when he told the joke.
This is a new kind of melon.
He who pays the piper, calls the tune.
I think I could learn a lot from you.
I have tried every means imaginable.
Tom turned down the offer.
I narrowly escaped being run over by a car.
I can wait no longer.
Are you questioning my loyalty?
I'm trying to work out this problem.
I deleted the file.
Did you see what she was wearing?
She loves watching tennis matches on TV.
I've seen it with my own eyes.
We all love you.
Tom is not far off the mark.
She shaves her legs.
That's a really good idea.
Don't be a coward.
You are a schoolteacher, aren't you?
This is Tom's address book.
You don't look well.
Tom asked Mary to help him reinstall Windows.
I really wish I could go with you, but I can't.
Would that be wise?
Tom donated money to the Red Cross to help survivors of the earthquake.
There are a lot of people who believe that Tom really is a time traveler.
I know almost nothing about you.
I am familiar with this neighborhood.
The company abandoned that project.
Some people are really good at spotting when others are lying.
He will be back in a second.
Exercise every day.
Tom doesn't like the way I speak.
Can I rest a bit?
The students demonstrated against the new government.
Tom said that he wanted to move to Boston because that's where Mary lives.
Can I see you in my office for a minute?
She invited me to the ballet.
Many students bought the book.
I like tennis the best of all sports.
That nickname fits him perfectly.
We are worried about you.
You can't go yet.
The wall was covered with pictures of gunshot victims.
Come out and play.
Would you mind if I asked you some questions?
All you have to do is go there.
We're here to protect you.
My eyes hurt.
Tom was grumpy.
I still haven't found Tom.
We just want you to be happy.
That's a pretty name.
Do what you like.
Her mother passed away last year.
I usually agree with her.

Think carefully before answering.
Tom ordered a bottle of wine.
You very nearly guessed it.
Does that guy look familiar to you?
This is an equilateral triangle.
Tom doesn't like being around children because he's always afraid of catching a cold from one of them.
Something has to be done.

I'm not totally stupid.
Don't you smell something unusual?
I realized Tom was right.

When was the last time you were at your parents'?
I will be back soon.

Put out your cigarette. Smoking's not permitted here.
I am hungry because I did not eat lunch.
Come along.
Will the price keep going up?
I saw your father.
Brush your teeth.
She passed by without glancing at me.
Carrots are good for your eyes.
He was wrong in thinking that she'd come to see him.
She has 3,500 books in her library and many of them are first editions.
Be kind to those around you.
That's what Tom said this morning.
I fear for Tom's safety.
Please make sure the drinking water is pure.
This is one of Boston's finest hotels.
Don't make noise here.
Tom didn't need to tell Mary. She already knew.

Would you like to have a cup of tea?
We need flour, sugar and eggs to make this cake.
Tom's a decent, law-abiding citizen.
I've lost my wallet.
Do you want to take that?
I'm afraid you're wrong.
She's missed the boat.
She flew to Europe by way of Siberia.
You're always welcome here.
Don't panic.
He's tall and handsome.
Every dog has his day.
Tell those people to back off so that the helicopter can land.
Tom didn't have to wait long.
Tom peeked inside the room.
Suppose your father saw us together, what would he say?
You're way smarter than I am.
Tom doesn't want me.
Do you think I should do it?
He declined to comment.
She was accompanied by her mother.
That's not why I took it.
Don't make noises when you eat soup.
May I have this dance?
Would you please turn off the TV?

He lived to be eighty years old.
Where do you write?
I got married yesterday.
It'll be difficult to glue the two pieces together.

The district is short of water.
Pizza is my favorite food.
She's an individualist.
I'll be counting on you to bring a salad.

Is there something you wanted to tell me?
You're quite drunk.
The washing machine is a wonderful invention.
They weren't bluffing.
Would you mind coming with me?
Tom ought to stop smoking.
I leave by train soon.
You should tell him the truth.
You will soon cease to think of her.
We met along the way.
Can you make yourself understood in French?

That's his house.
You're on your own.
What does his silence imply?
I saw her home.
Tom is more experienced in business than me.
Tom will be here for three days.
Tom didn't think you would like the idea.
The fingerprints left on the weapon match the suspect's.
Tom wants you fired.
The press confirmed the rumors.
When she was young, she was very popular.
Do you like any of these pictures?
We have waited for you the whole day.
Send it by airmail.
My neck still hurts.
I told Tom the reason I didn't want to do it was that I didn't think it was a good idea.
Close your books.
I'm trying to eat more vegetables.
Never trust anybody.
I want to see you in my office right now.
Tom is very good at videogames.
I want you to get off my back.
We did nothing wrong.
It's going nicely!
Come off it!
My parents aren't home.
When was the last time you ate a burrito?
You should be ashamed of your ignorance.
I hope Tom writes soon.
I knew you wouldn't forget Tom.
Here is a basket full of vegetables.
You came too late.
Bring me some cold water.
What're you reading?
Tom is dreaming.
Do you know if Tom has already eaten?
Is this your car?
You're the only one for me now.

What time do you finish work?
What will my parents think?
Tom asked Mary how John was doing.
We have to go.
My wife made me a delicious apple cake.
I have to keep trying.
You may take either of the books.
Tom saw you do that.
Tom and Mary picked up a hitchhiker.
These shoes don't fit.
You can't just leave your car parked in front of the fire hydrant.

Do you feel sorry for Tom?
I am terribly hungry.
The shoes are made of leather.
I'm sorry that you can't join us.
I recently met Tom.
Tom respects your opinion.
Security will be tightened.
I get it.
I want to say I'm sorry.
I talk to Tom on the phone every day.
Tom has already won.

You are someone very special to me.
The plane from Chicago arrived at the airport late at night.
I anticipated trouble.
Tom was given a six-month suspended sentence.

I'll come and see you at 3:00 p.m. on Sunday.
I'm relieving you of duty.
Have they called the meeting yet?
You should dress more modestly.
If I tell my mother, she'll worry, so I don't think I'll tell her.
They're no good.
Tom and Mary need to learn to work together.
How long can you stay?
That isn't it.
Just don't tell anybody where you got this.
Tom didn't want me to touch him.
Has Tom already told you what needs to be done?
There were many injured people, but hardly any people were missing.
I can't help feeling something's not quite right.
Who scolded Tom?
We are his children.
All my friends do it.
You're in safe hands now.
Who likes beans?
The room's nicely fixed up for the party.
We met at two in the afternoon.
I had a quick breakfast.
Tom doesn't usually wear pajamas.
Perhaps you could suggest something we can do tomorrow.
When was your most recent dental appointment?
Have you seen this man?
Tom and Mary were talking to each other.
I can find my own way out.
I didn't ask Tom to wait for me.
Tom is home alone.
Would you answer some questions for me?
Tom had trouble explaining what he wanted.
Tom will be a hundred years old next year.
Aren't you just a little bit curious?
I never want to see you get in trouble.
What are you doing up here?
She had no choice but to accept her fate.
Tom goes to bed at 10:30.
Does Tom want to go with us?
Could you use some help?
Tom is wearing flip-flops.
Did Tom like Boston?
You ruined all my plans.
A bead of sweat started forming on his brow.
Tom thanked Mary for the present.
I'm going to park the car.
In case of an emergency, dial 110.
Tom starved to death.
You didn't have to leave.
Promise me you won't say anything stupid.
Tom likes to write.
I'm not asking Tom.
He was killed in a railroad accident.
She kissed him on the forehead.
We don't miss anything.
I'd like to see the menu.
I apologize for my choice of words.
That was cooked in oil.
I can't believe Tom killed Mary.
There's nothing to lose.
He is not wearing a hat.
Tom bookmarked his favorite website.
Have you lost your mind?
She assured him that everything was OK.
What did you do today?
Nobody wants you to do this.
He cannot stop it.
We have broken off relations with them.
Tom tried to prove Mary's guilt.
Did that really just happen?
She sympathized with the orphan and gave him some money.
Do your parents know about this?
Tom is humiliated.
We asked him on the interphone if he could come downstairs quickly.
This soil is moist.
I don't want you to go.
Tom has gained weight since I last saw him.
She never dreamed she'd meet him overseas.
How many eggs were you able to get yesterday?
Don't worry about us.
I want a lot.
I know the situation is very difficult for us.
I spent three weeks in this hospital when I was thirteen years old.
I didn't realize how hungry I was.
Thanks again for your help.

I can't think of everything.
Tom wanted to get married.
She admitted to having stolen the jewels.
My father had me wash the car.
You could get arrested for that.
I have contacts in the White House.
Tom is always on the move.
I don't blame you for the accident. It wasn't your fault.
They say that Tom strangled Mary to death.
What high school did you go to?
I can't tell you what my plans are.
I'm asking you to do this because I trust you.
One of those people may be Tom.
That's going to cost you a lot of money.
I'd rather throw it away than give it to him.
Keep them.
Don't let your imagination run wild.
Tom was elected class president.
I have a sweet tooth.
How did you make it?
I asked Tom to call you.
Tom had the grim task of identifying Mary's body.
The wind blew her hair into her eyes.
I bet it will rain tomorrow.
I'm always moody.
I handed her her gloves.
I thought you were from Boston.
The news made her sad.
I no longer need a loan.
Thanks for coming over.
I didn't read the story.
I want to go to the park.
Tom told me that he wasn't scared of snakes.
Put some salt on your meat.
Where is your father?
Don't lose this key.
After eight months, he eventually started dating girls again.
I can't make out the meaning of this sentence.
He will be back soon.
He would sit and look at the sea for hours.
Tom left without saying goodbye.
He used his umbrella as a weapon.
He got a loan from the bank.
They don't know what they should do with the money.
Tom opened his mouth.
This river is not polluted.
We invited our new neighbors over for a drink.
I thought you might be curious.
Police brutality has been a problem for a long time.
Can you tell me why you like him?
We know what you're capable of.
He pretended not to know me.
The result was disappointing.
Tom can't afford to buy a yacht.
Do you have any idea where Tom might be waiting?
They carried him to a nearby house.
Don't come here anymore.
It's almost seven. We have to go to school.
We'll do it together.
Ask Tom if he'll stay in Australia.
We shouldn't have stayed up all night.
What happened to your car?
Could you break this ten dollar bill?
This is what my mother gave me when I got married.
Do you know how that could've happened?
Thanks for the information.
Smoking in the restaurant was forbidden.
Can I sleep here?
I need something smaller.
Have you been married for a long time?
I want Tom to do that.
People who break the law are punished.
Tom almost choked.
I'm grateful for your help.
I thought you'd find it interesting.
He lives near the beach.
He went to America to study medicine.
Tom looks bashful.
Tom is in his early thirties.
I don't have anything.
I guess that you can't do it.
I'm glad it's all over.
Tom answered the question correctly.
Please do not kill me.
It sounds like you want to be alone.
Pass me the salt, please.
Tom and Mary were smiling at each other.
They consider it impolite to disagree with someone they don't know very well.
Tom explained his plan in detail.
Tom had a problem with Mary.
What time do you start work?
What color is your hair?
It could've happened to anyone.
You need to learn to listen to our advice.
Would you like for me to do that for you?
I am starting this evening.
How often do you eat food you don't like?
Tom is ready to fight.
People often tell me more than I want to know.
We didn't need to call the doctor.
No one loves war.
I'll get ready.
They'll love that one.
Come anytime you like.
I need to hide these Christmas presents somewhere that Tom can't find them.
It was only yesterday that I called on him.
What have you done to your ear?
Hey, you're early.
I was asked to leave the classroom.
You need to lose some weight.
I don't like you, Tom.
I've got a few questions for you.
Can I see, too?
Tom bought Mary a puppy.
I'm sorry, I can't stay long.
I was kind of expecting that to happen.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
How much is this sofa?
Tom slipped on the wet floor and dislocated his knee.
A study reports that 53,000 Americans die each year as a result of secondhand smoke.
Tom got nervous.
I knew I should've given you a stronger dose.

Don't stay around here.
The passengers are waiting.
What color do you like?
Everyone is doing it.
They should know it.
Tom enjoyed his stay.
These shoes are hers.
We apologize for the inconvenience.
Leave out this word.
Why don't we ask his advice?
Tom wanted his son to live in Boston.
Tom had no idea Mary was sick.
You're OK.
Tom is now up.
He became financially independent.
The worst was yet to come.
They know our plans.
Beat the eggs with a whisk.
The train was to reach Paris at 8.
You're decisive.
Once in a while everything goes wrong.
We did nothing wrong.
He pestered her with questions.
I enjoyed swimming.
Don't be late for the train.
Tom asked me whether I was hungry.
It sounds like Tom.
Tom is deeply in love with Mary.
Why is it dark?
You have beautiful lips.
Tom gave Mary the wrong book deliberately.
Give it to me!
Vultures circled above the dead body.
I'll be in my study.
What symptoms do you have?
I'd love to go there one day.
They work hard.
What country were you born in?
I suppose he'll come.
She reserved a room.
Who was here?
Tom opened the refrigerator and took out one of the bottles.
Could you please tell Tom to be quiet?
Tom says it's OK.
We must take protective measures against floods.
Tom was there for me when I needed him.
The boss is an open person.
Tom's father is rich.
I counted up to 200.
Those students are Canadians.
Would you excuse me for a moment?
The noise kept me awake all night.
He advocated abolishing the death penalty.
My hair is too long.
Do you have any objections?
The ability to work hard is an admirable quality, but the ability to relax is equally important.
It's my favorite song.
Are you out of work?
Are you expecting any visitors?
The shy boy was utterly embarrassed in her presence.
Tom was given full custody of the children.
He tries.
Happy holidays.
They would have gotten a better exchange rate if they had gone to a bank.
Everybody has weaknesses.
I had not gone a mile when it began to rain.
Tom noticed something on the floor and bent down to see what it was.
I drank coffee.
In order to qualify for the homestay you must have an interview with the sponsors.
I wonder where he is hiding.
Gas is cheap now.
Get over here.
Maybe we should ask Tom if he wants this old piano.
Go on ahead. I'll catch up with you soon.
Tom is saving money so he can go abroad.
We have to start.
I saw it first.
It was very cold that evening.
We'll ask Tom.
Tom looked lonely.
Would you please lower your voice?
I want you to do that with Tom.
He admitted that he had committed the crime.
You shouldn't say that kind of thing when children are around.
I asked Tom when he was planning to go to Boston.
Tom found Mary's diary.
He began to run.
Parts of the book are quite good.
He's a professor at the National University.
He walks his dog every morning.
I brush my teeth after eating.
What has he done to you?
It's gotten dark.
Tom said he was glad that he did that.
Tom got into his car and quickly drove off.
I will pay my debt as soon as possible.
We're not going out.
Show me what you have hidden behind your back.
Tom put his bags in the trunk, then hopped in the car and drove off.
Use it or lose it.
She visited not only Kyoto but also Nara.
Tom said that he thought Mary knew where John had found the key she'd lost.
She has two cats. One is black, and the other is white.
May I call you Tom?
Tom adjusted the mirrors.
Do you go to church every Sunday?
I love watching you cook.
How far do we have to go?
The burglar gained access to the house through a window.
I wouldn't want to do anything that would make Tom angry.
Have the police been notified?
I think that guy looks like Tom.
I suppose you want to ask me how I was able to make so much money in so little time.
Tom has been doing that for a number of years.
Tom should've called.
The police are searching for Tom.
That would be prudent.
I want to get a sightseeing visa.
My sister is pretty.
He ran out of money.
Did you enjoy the exhibition?
Have you read it?
It isn't like that.
How long's this going to take?
Don't you know what this is?
She has to stop smoking.
That brown one is mine, too.
Did you make it?
We'll follow Tom.
Shouldn't you overlook his indiscretions and forgive him?
Tom looks very afraid.
She refused to eat her lunch.
It's difficult to explain.
I'll help you as long as I live.
I didn't let Tom know that I knew how to speak French.
Let me think about it a little longer.
Could you please tell me what your cell phone number is?
Do you play the guitar?
We have nothing to complain about.
These socks are a bargain.
Have you ever kissed a girl?
Tom wasn't depressed, but Mary was.
Tom was here, too.
I always think of him when I'm alone.
Tom needs this.
It's not as big a problem as you think.
The suit's custom-made.
Why are you wearing a tux?
You are old enough to know this.
He was happily married.
Please turn up the air conditioner.
His house is easy to find.
We're not dead yet.
The conference drew 150 diplomats.
Maybe they know something.
Somebody tried to kill Tom.
I felt my hands tremble.
Let's pitch the tent while it's still light.
This tree is approximately three hundred years old.
You are very brave.
"How many push-ups can you do, Tom?" "I used to be able to do a hundred easily, but I wonder how many I can do now. Maybe 50 or so?"
It's an embarrassing question.
Tom is getting impatient.
Tom translated the letter from French into German.
Did you think that I was joking?
It's not necessary to come tomorrow.
Tom bought his truck used.
I won't be intimidated.
If Tom had asked Mary for advice first, he wouldn't have had this problem.
Why weren't we told the truth?
You don't need to do that right away.
I hated school.
I've just finished packing.
Tom, put these gloves on.
Tom couldn't convince everyone.
The stadium is adjacent to the school.
What's Tom doing?
We introduced ourselves to each other.
He intrigues me.
You have only to ask for it.
Why are you so late?
Tom has a big dog.
I always order the daily special when I eat lunch at this restaurant.
She is out on an errand.
It's up to you.
With this much money, I could buy a very decent used car.
I went for a walk in the park.
It was a good five kilometers from the station to the school.
It is truly a nice day today.
I'm afraid you have got the wrong number.
This joke is not funny.
I always carry a knife.
Tom may do that.
I guess now you know how Tom must've felt.
Pay very close attention.
I could answer his question.
Why do you use this font?
Try it once more.
I'm still looking for a job.
Achilles was an ancient Greek hero.
Can you help me get my money back from Tom.
Tom and Mary had three children.
I'm not leaving until you tell me what I want to know.
It's a golden retriever.
I'm very tired.
There's still one thing I don't understand.
Tom will never change.
Don't make me do that.
The dog walked across the street.
American English isn't better than British English.
You should call your father as soon as possible.
He loves singing.

That sounds too good to be true.
I find this disgusting.
He said that Tokyo is a safe city.
Let's go as soon as Tom gets here.
You look fat.
We cut the watermelon and ate it.
Do you mind if I ask you something?
They've located Tom.
Many couples disagree about having babies.
I was filled with joy.
My brother is a professor.
I don't have any brothers.
Tom almost never asks questions.
The couple doesn't fight often these days, but they used to a lot.
So you really don't know?
I said this a long time ago.
I'm here because I need your help.
Tom believes in the supernatural.
Will that be for here or to go?
Long, long ago, there lived an old man in a village.
I met Mary yesterday.
Tom hanged himself in jail.
Tom asked Mary if she wanted to go with him.
I thanked Mary for her help.
Why do you think Tom doesn't like it?
This is a real surprise.
Tom reserved a seat.
Tom didn't even try to help Mary.
The submarine can dive up to 300 meters.
You simply don't understand.
The dog next door is always barking.
This book sells very well.
The ladies were in evening dress.
Maybe I should go help Tom.
I used to ride my bike to school, but now I take the bus.
She then proceeded to negotiate with her bank.
Our refrigerator is out of order.
I bought a VW bus.
I'll stay there till six o'clock.
Both Tom and Mary are sitting over there.
They know something we don't.
Did you see the solar eclipse yesterday?
Tom knew it was wrong to do what he did.
Has a solution been found?
It belongs to Tom.
I want to become a French teacher.
She took pity on him.
Why do you have so many cats?
They were in the right place at the right time.
Tom never speaks unless spoken to.
Tom met Mary on the way to school.
Tom took notes.
Tom started packing his backpack.
Life is unfair.
The worst is yet to come.
May I call you Tom?
You're not a morning person, are you?
Can we roller-skate in this park?
Tom had no idea why everyone was laughing.
Smoking is forbidden in this area.
Tom likes to do that here.
You have taught him well.
It may look easy, but it's not.
Tom isn't mad at you.
Try not to fall.
Who told you I was Canadian?
How barbaric!
I am going to stay here for a couple of days.
Tom is a dependable person.
I'll call you right after the meeting.
I am to meet him there.
I'm not your enemy.
I suggest we get away from here as soon as possible.
I don't think that's a real word.
How can you be so cruel?
She invited him in for a cup of coffee.
Tom fell in the swimming pool.
She hugged him.
This story is true.
You should study hard so that you can pass the examination.
You can't prove a thing.
We don't know what Tom said.
Watch the road.
Tom stayed in the shallow end of the pool.
Tom looked up at the sky.
Who is this pretty girl?
Why'd you do that?
Don't forget to call me.
Is it your first day at school?
How often do you buy new clothes?
I think it's a very interesting question.
It's characteristic of him to behave like that.
Let's play poker.
I've got a little job for you.
Tom looks trapped.
Are you sure Tom doesn't have a girlfriend?
His technique was unique and absolutely amazing.
Why are you not satisfied?
He died and his soul went to hell.
I took Tom's blood pressure.
The wall is two meters thick.
I think Mary likes me.
Here's what we don't know.
What would make you happy?
I don't know. What do you think?
The woman washes her face.
Tom says he did not mean to kill her.
Do you want to see where Tom is buried?
Tom doesn't have to do that today.
I can't risk getting captured again.
Tom was able to get there in less than twenty minutes.
We have to operate immediately.
Do you think that's wise?
Tom has been putting on weight.
It was a gift.
Tom left the water running.
It's always like that.
Mary used her smartphone as a mirror to touch-up her makeup.
I'm shy.
I won't bother you again, I promise.
Tom ate nothing.
You should wash your car.
I love winning.
The installation is now complete.
We shouldn't have told Tom what we told him.
We're quite tired.
I carried out Tom's instructions.
Where can I get in touch with you?
The exhibition will be open for another month.
It was only a joke.
My mother was very pretty when she was young.
Where can I pick up my baggage?
Tom put on his pajamas and climbed into bed.
That's why I told you that you shouldn't go alone.
Tom found out later that the woman he met in the park was Mary.
The next meeting will take place in a few days.
You have cancer.
I told you before not to do that.
Which is your book?
Have I changed that much?
I don't care.
Tom told me he was going to go home early today.
What did you eat for lunch today?
Have you told Tom why he shouldn't be doing it that way?
I don't think that he's honest.
Have you decided what you'll do?
I cannot release that information. It is private.
The body had burned beyond recognition.
Who's your favorite celebrity?
I want you to go and see if it's still there.
Tom has to stay in the house because he has the chicken pox.
I'll put it somewhere safe.
Don't you ever say anything?
Did you have to share a bedroom with your brothers or sisters?
Let me look at you.
Tom's house is just about three kilometers from here.
Can you carve the chicken?
You're avoiding my question.
Don't cheat him.
We were attacked from behind.
Tom is sitting right next to me.
Tom still has to tell Mary what to do.
Do you miss your friends?
That's my sister.
Tom pointed to a word on the sign and asked Mary what it meant.
Lots of old people are killed in traffic accidents every year.
Is that important?
All of a sudden, three dogs appeared in front of us.
His life is hanging by a thread.
Tom showed us his mother's picture.
I really like this singer.
Considering everything, my father's life was a happy one.
Tom, what would you like to have for dinner?
Thank you for your patience.
Who is your favorite author?
How much time do you spend on Facebook?
See you there.
I wonder whether Tom is as old as Mary.
I asked Tom if he would mind doing that.
Tom wanted me to tell you he needs to borrow your car.

A fire broke out near my house.
Tom ironed his shirts.
I'll make you happy no matter what happens.
Mary hasn't painted her room yet.
I attend a public school.
Do you have a better explanation?
She tried to lower her expenses.
Tom wasn't pleased.
How long did you sleep last night?
Tell Tom I have to work late tonight.
I think I'd like that.
Tom tiptoed into the room.
I don't mind the cold, but I can't stand the heat.
Put that knife away.
You don't understand.
I'd like you to have a thorough examination.
I think Tom should do it.
He married an actress.
Millions of people starve to death every year.
Mary and Alice always wear similar clothes.
Tell everybody.
Tom's eyes were red from crying.
I think it's highly unlikely that Tom will be allowed to keep the gold that he found.
Tom lives there.
I think it won't be a problem.
He lost his life in an accident.
Where can I put my bag?
Tom had lunch with Mary.
It looks like you've already been replaced.
What are they for?
I'm not a magician.
Have you forgotten everything we've done for you?
I couldn't have done it without your help.
Tom comes to school by car.
My father worked hard night and day.
I have sunglasses.
There's a hole in my coat.
You'd better not go out today.
There's a nice Thai restaurant near here.
You're the woman I love.
My friend is bilingual.
It was pretty obvious.
I don't know if you remember me, but we met a couple of years ago in Boston.
You could do that.
It was very strange.
How long do you want it for?
She testified that she saw the man.
Tom walked towards the elevator.
He came by bus.
I made a big mistake.
Do you have one a little bigger than these?
The dog is white.
I think Tom is happy.
Because of you, I'm having problems with my blood pressure.
Tom is very impolite.
There was a moon that night.
I think this is the best part.
They whispered to each other.
At last she got a job as a stewardess.
I'm glad you noticed.
This plant is edible.
That's the best way of settling it.
I want Tom to know that.
You're both crazy.
There is enough room for everybody.
I thought you said Tom was stupid.
In case of a fire, use the stairs.
The car bumped the tree.
I need to take your pulse.
You shouldn't have gone to such a dangerous place.
I have an idea she will come today.
Tom doesn't care whether Mary does her homework or not.
I'm really glad you decided to come.
I want some answers and I want them now.
I would like to be alone.
A war broke out between the two countries.
It is necessary that you see a doctor.
This telephone is connected to the fax machine.
I should do that right away.
Tom has gone to Boston on business.
Which one is mine?
Why didn't you say goodbye?
Can you at least pretend you want to be here?
Tom is coming here, isn't he?
This scenery is magnificent.
You two have a lot in common.
Is there a mall near here?
I shouldn't have trusted you.
We were just talking about you when you called.
The painting is not worth the price you are asking.
The escaped prisoner is still at large.
If you wish to speak to Tom, you'll need to wait about three hours.
Tom has one for you.
The answer is completely wrong.
I can't get used to it.
He left early in order not to be late.
Tom grabbed my hand.
I can't believe it's already time to go home.
Was all of that true?
Do you know what they want?
He was a famous poet and a competent diplomat.
You're asking me questions you already know the answers to.
Her daughter has become a beautiful woman.
Why do I have to go?
Tom seems clever.
Tom readily admits his mistakes.
He spoke in a broken English that was hard to understand.
Why did you do what you did?
The days are getting longer.
It's the third of October.
Mary is knitting Tom a scarf.
Tom usually eats his lunch alone.
Leave us.
I'd like to talk about your situation.
Tom is still in the kitchen, washing dishes.
Can't you help me just a little bit?
We waited for Tom at the library for thirty minutes, but he never showed up.
Please put the table next to the wall.
We're having some guests over this evening.
That's what I want.
Tom is a man of few words.
It's one thing to make plans, but quite another to carry them out.
Don't give me anything.
I sat next to him.
Wash your hands well.
Let me know if there is anything I can do.
Tom stayed in his car.
The children played in the snow.
Could you turn down the TV?
Who has it now?
The garden was overgrown with weeds.
Lay it on the table.

What do you want for breakfast?
Don't smoke in the toilet.
This stinks.

I don't think Tom would ever let me read his diary.
Please speak slowly.
I'm a childhood friend of Tom's.
I can't believe you actually said that.
We'll likely never know for sure.
I never noticed before that you're taller than me.
Tell me what has become of him.
Tom lost his umbrella.
He never cared much for me.
Please give my best regards to your parents.
What do you use this for?
Tom should be here.
She doesn't shave her legs.
I don't know what it's for.
I found it difficult to get along with him.
Tom isn't at home, but Mary is.
He gave a detailed description of the accident.
Tom wasn't OK, but Mary was.
The more she talked, the more bored I got.
Tom isn't good at sports.
As time went on, our hopes sank.
What's that you're working on?
The game was postponed until next week.
Tom asked Mary to pick up some toothpaste and some toilet paper at the supermarket.
Who wouldn't love to find one of these under the tree on Christmas morning?
We assumed you were dead.
I'm waiting for a response from her.
Suddenly Tom began to cry.
He's big and strong.
Did you enjoy the film?
My cat rubbed her head against my shoulder.
Why do you think?
Did you forget to buy eggs?
What a good shot!
I'm looking for you.
The child followed me to the park.
I asked Tom some questions and he answered all of them.
It's raining everywhere.

All you need to do is wait.
This is the longest novel that I have ever read.

She isn't fit for the job.
I liked the movie.
I'll cook tonight.
Tom is a much better liar than I thought.
Take off your cap.
Get away from here.
I asked him not to bother me.
I'm sorry to be so late. The meeting completely slipped my mind.
They talked about politics.
Are you sure you don't want coffee?
About how much money do you have?
Tom is a good athlete.
He kept calm in the face of the danger.
Even though he's very old, he's healthy.
I am exhausted.
Put it in your pocket.
You have to follow the rules.
There are many things which we cannot evaluate in terms of money.
Count to ten.

How do you milk a cow?
I honestly don't care.
Who are you calling stupid?

Tom started whistling a happy tune.
That stuff is poisonous.

We're staying there for three months.
Let's get out of here before it's too late.
How is your family name written?
I'm retired.
Don't talk to me like I'm a child.
I know Tom is innocent.
Why don't you like it here?
He did his duty.
I want a jump rope with wooden handles.
Half of the apples are rotten.
My father used to read me bedtime stories.
Which one is mine?
You have my permission to leave.
You're not going to believe this.
We felt relieved when we saw a light in the distance.
I'm beginning to get jealous.
Tom seemed wise.
You should arrive at school before nine.

It's pretty cold outside.

He waited for several seconds and opened the door.
The house has a dining room, a bedroom and a study.
Could you do me a favor?

What time is it now by your watch?
Would you like fries with that?
Luck is against me.
I'm glad you agree.
At that time, we were quite rich.
Where do you use it?
I would never kiss Tom.
I will sue you.
Thank you for the tickets.
Why don't you like Tom?
What time did you go to bed last night?
That man looks vaguely familiar.
Tom came home earlier than Mary expected.
Tom killed himself on his thirtieth birthday.
I'll never leave you.
She advised him to take the medicine.
The price is up to you.
Are you sure there's nothing else to eat?
Do you want another cup of coffee?
Who did you hear that rumor from?
Ask Tom not to go there.
Nobody encouraged her.
When was the first time you came here?
He was just behind me.
Ask me again in October.
Did you come by car?
I saw Tom running down the street.
Tom has some explaining to do.
Would you mind making an extra cup of coffee whenever you decide to have some?
I'll tell you what I want you to do.
My parents got divorced.
Do you smell that?
What are you doing here, Tom? Mary doesn't want to see you.

I've got to leave soon.
No one's in sight.
He is successful in everything.

I think you're interesting.
Tom cooked the books.
You and Tom are welcome to stay for dinner.
There is no hope of success.
Is your room clean?
They will be safe with him.
Don't worry about the results.
You're such a couch potato.
Tom prefers to take a shower in the morning while Mary prefers to take a bath just before going to bed.
We were running to and fro.
Please do that.
Was there something wrong with the car?
Do you like this?
He goes to school by bicycle.
I think that Tom could do better if he tried harder.
They fell.
I can't walk in these shoes.
One of my suitcases is missing.
I have something to give you.
Let's have our picture taken with the statue in the back, shall we?
Tom told me that he got his xylophone for free.
He is too short to get at the book on the shelf.
