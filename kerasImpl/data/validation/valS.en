Have you ever had a pet?
Tom is making a list.
Everyone needs friends.
Will you use this?
I require your assistance.
Let's not rush things.
He thought it would be wise to accept the offer.
You're very good at this.
We should probably postpone the competition.
I go to school.
My opinion is a little different from yours.
Do Tom and Mary know why you're here?
You were the one who suggested it.
I've just lost the best friend I ever had.
Can you put that into English?
Look what you made me do.
The airplane took off as soon as I arrived at the airport.
I'm in Portugal.
Tom's phone rang.
They're almost three times as big as we are.
Tom and Mary want to talk to me.
This is one of the nicest restaurants in Boston.
They kissed inside the planetarium.
Tom showed Mary some pictures of his house.
Lack of food made them very hungry.
I can't hear a thing.
I speak from experience.
I'm here to help in any way I can.
They were playing a game of checkers.
What's the answer to my question?
It'll rain soon.
Tom and Mary chatted about the weather.
I can't believe it's already time to go home.
Do you know the man standing on the bridge?
I jog twice a week.
I'm sorry.
When times get hard, let's see who sticks around.
What were you doing there?
The house is said to be haunted.
Not all of them are present.
You can see a lot of stars in the sky.
Horses can sense fear.
I went from door to door trying to sell encyclopedias.
I've heard worse.
I'll wait here until they come back.
Tom pushed the raft into the water.
Are you still together?
I'm OK.
A pinched sciatic nerve can be excruciatingly painful.
It was eighty meters long.
He stayed at the hotel for two days.
Why is autumn called "fall" in America?
I need his help.
I didn't think you'd remember me.
Tom may be in Boston.
It never occurred to me that she was sick in the hospital.
My friends scolded me for my stupid behavior.
They all knew Tom.
This is my bicycle.
She wanted him to take care of her parents.
Tom didn't remember me.
Where's the mirror?
He didn't want to disappoint his mother.
He is managing the business for his father.
I arrived at the village before dark.
I really wish there was something I could do.
The movie's about to start.
I've got a message for you.
My daughter is in the hospital because she was injured in a traffic accident.
My favorite TV show's been canceled.
Maybe I should've told Tom.
If she were still alive, Billie Holiday would be 100 today.
Tom taught Mary how to play the piano.
Finally she gave in to temptation and ate the whole cake.
Tom betrayed us.
Does Tom know where Mary was born?
There is nothing to be scared of.
That's our secret.
Just keep your promise.
The experiment has to begin.
I'll see you this afternoon.
You have no idea who that is, do you?
My aunt sent me a birthday present.
I did everything in my power to protect her from you.
Did you like Boston?
It's hard to keep up with you.
What led you to believe so?
I'm impressed by how well you speak French.
We must change our plan.
They were badly in need of water.
You should give up smoking.
I was very ill at ease with those people.
How could we have been so wrong?
Tom saw Mary on TV.
That's not my car.
Tom had an upset stomach.
Is there any chance of your coming to Tokyo again this year?
You have a habit of exaggerating everything.
We can't ignore Tom.
Will you go, too?
He would often say such a thing.
No one cares about me.
Tom sat in the driver's seat and adjusted the rearview mirror.
I asked him if I could read his book.
I have a feeling I've met her somewhere before.
Tom is on the day shift this month.
I never want to see your face again.
Tom doesn't allow his son to eat ice cream.
Frankly speaking, he is untrustworthy.
Tom was always different from other children.
No one else came to the meeting.
How big is your house?
I'm not an early riser.
That's not what I just heard.
Tom is a father.
All our food was rotten.
Isn't this what you want?
His hands feel rough.
I know you miss Tom.
It is time to go.
I don't belong to any club.
I think that's too expensive.
Tom is sending a fax.
I found that the machine was of no use.
That man has a bad reputation.
He provides for his family.
My wish has finally come true.
Don't do anything to attract attention to yourself.
It's not over yet.
Any one of us could do it.
She made some derogatory remarks about her colleagues.
What would Tom say if he walked in right now?
He is the last person I would want to go skiing with.
Tom can explain the situation.
One of the keys to happiness is to do what you enjoy doing.
I'll see you a week from today.
Tom looks baffled.
That's a great idea.
I'll give you an answer in a day or two.
Tom couldn't find his left shoe.
You have to believe in yourself.
What do you think I'm doing?
We should bring another bottle of wine.
We were talking about something at that time, but I don't remember what.
She has never been asked out on a date.
What's your friend's name?
You'd better not do it.
You're just jealous.
They were acting strangely.
Tom took a book off the shelf and handed it to Mary.
In spite of the fact that she was busy, she came to see me.
We only take cash.
Do any of you know Tom?
Tom keeps a pair of binoculars in the glove compartment of his car.
We had a snowball fight.
Look at these photos.
I thought you'd ask that.
Excuse me, what did you say?
We drank all night.
Tom put a bunch of letters on Mary's desk.
This CD is my son's.
She talks about Paris as if she had been there many times.
I can't explain it now.
Just don't drop it.
Why doesn't Tom talk?
You should've said so earlier.
There's a trampoline in the backyard.
The elevator stopped on the second floor.
My dad's name is Tom.
Why would Tom be angry?
Do you think we'll win?
Tom asked Mary questions.
Your answer to the question is not correct.
No smoking is allowed in this train station.
Mary broke up with her boyfriend.
Where did you get that scratch on your cheek?
A little bird told me.
I know you're trying very hard.
Tom went to Boston to attend a conference.
I was told that you know Tom's telephone number.
How do you spell your family name?
I was trying to lose weight.
Take care of the kids for me.
Don't call me again.
My aunt lives in New York.
I won't make you do anything you don't want to.
Do you have snow tires for your car?
Does anyone still have a question?
I broke his heart.
I have done it before.
I'm going to send my mother some flowers.
Would that be suitable?
Do you want me to come in with you?
Tom worked on the job alone.
We're going to do everything we can to find Tom.
We'll stop Tom.
I wonder if I could talk with you for a moment.
She was ill for a long time.
Is that black bag yours?
I hope you're doing well.
Tom was so busy he skipped lunch.
I disagree with just about everything Tom just said.
It works perfectly. You just don't know how to use it.
You do that faster than I do.
Tom got dressed and slipped on his shoes.
Mother has just gone out shopping.
I can't discuss it.
You should have learned how to swim when you were young.
Fix the watch.
If the alarm rings, walk, don't run.
Tom has bought a new car.
Tom slammed his bedroom door closed.
I don't think I've heard that word in a long time.
Tom falls asleep every night watching TV.
Even Tom wouldn't be stupid enough to do that.
Do you drink beer or wine?
I had my job interview in the meeting room.
This sentence may be interpreted another way.
Don't believe everything you read.
It is neither good nor bad.
We spent the entire day in Yoyogi Park.
When I woke up this morning, the rain had turned into snow.
They will die.
It seems like there's no money left.
Just answer the question.
Is that the train I have to take?
How are you getting along with your study?
Parking is prohibited here.
Have you decided whether or not you're going to sell your house?
Did you get the message?
When was the last time you crossed a river?
Tom is inflating a balloon.
Would you like something to drink?
I'm not going to ask Tom that question.
He is tremendously handsome.
Do you really think that your plans are realistic?
Money doesn't buy happiness.
When was the last time you smoked a cigarette?
Why don't we drop by to see her?
Why didn't you call me earlier?
I saw Tom play tennis.
The alarm didn't wake Tom.
I meant it as a joke.
Grades are important, but they are not everything.
Tom only thinks about money.
It takes two to tango.
I can't help but wonder if Tom will be at school tomorrow.
You are to stay here until we come back.
You smell just like my mother.
I have never heard him speak ill of others.
We're meant for each other.
He is what we call a self-made man.
I must go alone.
She is envious of my success.
You're incompetent.
I can read your thoughts.
When he retired, his son took over his business.
She stopped smoking.
I didn't order it.
We have to use the stairs, because the elevator is being repaired.
Enjoy your food.
Where will you be on Monday?
As soon as he saw me, he ran away.
What did you do last night?
Tom is responsible for this accident.
Do you wish you could travel in space?
May I have a look at your ticket?
Let's suppose it's true.
I'll go and have a look.
Maybe Tom is in love.
I'm hitting the road.
I deleted my Facebook account.
Are you going to attend ceremony?
Tom has been grounded for a week.
This is worth one million yen.
He was supposed to go to school.
The old man kept to himself.
None of us are cowards.
He's not in.
This is a nightmare.
You're starting to annoy me.
Tell me where you plan to go for your summer vacation.
Tom and Mary are still just kids.
I met her on campus yesterday.
Tom had a girlfriend named Mary.
Tom was embarrassed by the incident.
Tom told Mary about his imaginary friend.
Hi, my name is Pekka. What is your name?
Tom is already married.
It was the first time that I visited the museum.
I hope it was as much fun for you as it was for me.
I wonder why Tom was disobedient.
Tom reached into the sack and pulled out some coins.
Show Tom how it's done.
The dog fetched the stick.
I am supposed to babysit the children tonight.
Tom helped Mary stand up.
Is this of any use to you?
Tom and Mary instantly recognized one another.
I feel quite at ease among strangers.
A gigantic bird came flying toward him.
I want to become an astronaut.
There's ice on the sidewalk and it's slippery.
Why don't you believe Tom when he says he's busy?
The children broke the ancient urn.
It hardly ever rains in the area.
Faith will move mountains.
Every man can't be an artist.
Let's just try to have a good time.
I was born there.
I can't see a way out of this.
Do you really want to go to Germany?
We'll pray for you.
Tom made Mary do that.
I have a sweet tooth.
Mom is making a cake.
I couldn't sleep all night.
You had better go to bed now.
You're double-parked.
This website can damage your computer.
Tom was already in the classroom when I got there.
Tom took an apple from the fruit bowl.
We miss you very much.
The victory is ours.
I have as much time as you do.
Tom is very excited.
Tom put the bowl of popcorn on the table.
Is there something you want to tell me?
Today is Saturday.
He looked up at the stars.
Just tell the truth.
What? What did you say?
Can you believe it? She's even lazier than me.
Are you going to break in?
I don't know you.
I was hungry.
Where are the others?
She and I are the same age.
The strike affected the nation's economy.
I'm proud of my father being a good cook.
Since they were tired, they turned in earlier than usual.
Our little girl is growing up.
I wonder if Tom is having as much fun as Mary.
What time does the store open?
Tom should've been here by now.
I need to warn my mom.
That's just not true.
What's the name of your ship?
I'm unlucky.
You want to leave here, don't you?
Will you cook something for me?
I need a smoke.
Tom deserves a promotion.
They make a perfect couple.
Tom didn't seem surprised when he heard that Mary and John had gotten married.
Can I have the key now, please?
Tom began to sing "Happy Birthday" and the entire restaurant joined in.
Which cup did you drink out of?
I tried to persuade Tom to do that, but I couldn't.
We're conservative.
It hurt more than I thought it would.
When did you go to London?
Tom doesn't eat meat and neither does Mary.
Sit down on the bench.
Tom has a cold.
I have no memory of what happened.
You need a key to open the box.
I will see to it that you meet her at the party.
I've often wondered what it must be like to be rich.
We should call Tom.
There's something wrong with me.
Someone told me that people with type O blood attract more mosquitoes than people with any other blood type.
I'm afraid that's not good enough.
You'll get pneumonia.
Tom decided to risk it all.
Please pick me up at the hotel at six o'clock.
The factory always made good quality shoes.
On a clear day, we can see Mt. Fuji from here.
This smells like cheese.
This is what I get paid to do.
Tom was up until about 3:00 a.m. reading a book.
Her carpet is completely white.
I thought about you.
I barely know you.
Did you get their letter?
The boy was lying on his stomach watching TV.
How many Canadian friends do you have?
There's so much left for me to learn.
Tom speaks French better than he pretends to.
You've done this before, haven't you?
Have you found an answer to this question?
Tom hugged Mary.
Look, here comes your train.
Will you pay attention, please?
Where is your sister?
Where will she put them?
I want to know why you don't like me.
You haven't heard the half of it yet.
Life doesn't get any better.
They did not have time to search for it.
She must have been a beauty when she was young.
Tom inherited a large fortune.
Always pay attention to your surroundings.
You must be more polite.
Come on, I'll give you a ride home.
Tom was a little worried about Mary.
I just don't think I'm successful enough.
I know a man who speaks French.
That's the last straw.
He is the only child they have.
Lions are stronger than wolves.
Tom has three million dollars in the bank.
The old clock is still in use.
Tom went to the drugstore to buy some cough syrup.
"You never told me that!" "Yes, I did!"
I don't think I'll go to Tom's party.
I'm going to show this to Tom.
Don't you love me anymore?
What is going on?
I have another year at high school.
Tom wants to do that, too.
Raise your hand if you know the answer.
We'll finish it if it takes us all day.
I felt very troubled by the news.
That's what I do.
I don't want to see you.
I'm not in it for the money.
Everyone was drinking.
We haven't heard from Tom in a long time.
Tom passed his driving test on his first attempt.
I was impressed with her work.
You can't handle the truth.
Why don't you go and see?
We have finished lunch.
I'm going to take this.
Tom cheated on the history exam.
I am brushing my teeth.
Rules are meant to be broken.
They appointed him chairman.
That building is the tallest in Japan.
Tom grew up in a small town in Australia.
Tom dropped to his knees.
I like to learn new things.
There was no answer to my question.
He is an old friend of mine.
I was just wondering what languages you can speak.
Get Tom to help you.
He's not smart enough to add numbers in his head.
When will you bring back my umbrella?
Were you happy with the results?
It's a pity that you can't come.
I didn't know Tom was so lonely.
The animal died from hunger.
When does it end?
I know this will work.
If you keep breaking the club rules, you'll get thrown out.
He must be severely punished.
I would like something to drink.

Where is my ball?
Please help yourself to the cookies.
Let's start the meeting now.
There is a bench on the balcony.
I was left behind.
I saw something white in the park.
Is something bothering you?
Tom walked Mary to the elevator.
I'll give Tom half of my share.
I should've done this months ago.
I'm dying to see you.
The music is too loud.
Whether rains or not, the game is going to be held.
What I want isn't tea, but coffee.
I admire your optimism.
Would you mind watching my kids?
Stay with us for a few days.
The room is full of flowers.
I am very pleased.
You're rude and disrespectful.
I owe everything to you.
Have you seen her?
Tom lost the watch that Mary gave him.
His position enabled him to do so.
They are looking for chairs to sit on.
He reached across the table and shook my hand.
The door wouldn't shut.
You must hurry up.
How can I prevent my cat from killing birds?
Tom stopped dancing.
I lost 30 pounds.
If you don't do that, I'll give you $300.
I'm going to go to the doctor this afternoon.
Tom doesn't have to know.
Tom has decided to keep a diary this year.
How about another beer?
Why don't you come over to my place sometime?
He loves to fish.
Tom was scared and confused.
Have you eaten dinner?
Tom sort of took me under his wing.
Can I help you find something?
Can you guess my age?
My father lives and works in Tokyo.
He didn't see a thing.
I hope nobody saw you doing that.
My son is tired of hamburgers.
I have to leave now.
Are you with us, Tom?
I can't order Tom to do it.
I thought you two knew each other.
Aren't you a Canadian?
Tom has a good chance of being hired for the job.
I caught a cold two days ago.
A boy came running towards me.
His public support for the British government was unpopular.
How did Tom know that Mary wouldn't be here?
I'm worried about Tom.
I am praying.
Do you have any plans for the weekend?
This town hasn't changed a bit since the 1970's.
Why don't you ask me what you really want to know?
She's my godmother.
I only found out about that a few days ago.
I tend to look at the pictures before reading the text.
Write your name in capitals.
This is my car.
He left the motor running.
Old people wake up early.
While I was cleaning out my desk, I came across this old picture.
I was in the area, so I thought I'd drop by.
Sorry, I didn't hear you.
I assume after work you're going home right away.
You were lucky that you didn't get caught in the rain.
Everyone looked at Tom.
How is this even possible?
Where did you go on your summer vacation?
Birds sing early in the morning.
The girl playing the piano is my sister.
Did you get in touch with Tom?
I am afraid that it will rain.
How are you and Tom getting along?
Who is the man who was talking with you?
Is there a woman in your life?
Tom is wearing his soccer uniform.
Please don't worry about me.
My brother is interested in English and music.
I don't know for certain.
Leave it to us.
We are trying a completely new method.
I'll be in my office if you need me.
If you buy me an ice cream, I'll give you a kiss.
It was so hot that I thought I was going to pass out.
Do you like science fiction movies?
The work has already begun.
Tom smiled at me.
I'm sure Tom will come back as soon as he realizes he left his briefcase here.
For that reason, he lost his job.
He suffered internal injuries in the car accident.
I am convinced that he did nothing wrong.
I was fortunate to make his acquaintance.
Tom looked at the photograph.
I'd rather you came tomorrow than today.
I do not believe in the existence of God.
Do you think Tom saw Mary?
Was I seen leaving?
Have you seen the recipe book that I wrote?
A woman whose husband is dead is called a widow.
That would be nice.
I returned the knife which I had borrowed.
This should be fun.
Tom did it for his family.
His daughter is a nurse.
Don't mess with Tom.
Give the keys to Tom.
Tom has had a bad week.
It took her a long time to choose a hat.
He earns a living.
The cup has a crack.
Do you feel like going out for a drive in the country over the weekend?
Would you mind not doing that?
They stood up for what was right.
Why would I do such a thing?
I asked Tom where he had gone to school.
Are we leaving soon?
Tom certainly knows a lot about Australia.
Tom has been taking walks at night.
Tom was surprised how well Mary could swim.
I started working for this company last year.
You may go there.
I was invited to her birthday party.
Who are those children?
Tom is in Australia visiting his parents.
Have you made any New Year's resolutions?
What exactly has Tom done?
Tom tried to camouflage himself.
I want to be like Tom.
I will go on foot.
The smallest continent is Australia.
My son is not a snob.
Tom looks cool.
This is all Tom has to do.
You're lying to me.
The precise time of their arrival is not known.
Tom tried his best to move the table by himself, but he couldn't.
We'll deal with it tomorrow.
Tom is several years older than Mary.
He knows German and French, not to mention English.
Go to the living room.
Tom has a bicycle.
I want to hear Tom's voice.

The lemon is sour.
Some people were late.
Tom often has trouble remembering things.

Tom knows what it's about.
You're the only person who ever comes to visit me.
He ran away with the diamond.
Tom drinks too much.
Since he could not work out the problem that way, he tried another way.
Tom tricked Mary into doing his work for him.
She decided to marry him even though her parents didn't want her to.
Easy does it.
I'll try again.
We're really close and we tell each other everything.
Do you know why?
This one is for us.
Tom's mean.
I would never want this to change.
Don't lie.
Tom didn't think what Mary was wearing was appropriate for the occasion.
We don't have any sheep.
Do you want to live in Boston?
Would you like to go to the theater this evening?
Tom would've loved the concert.
Does anyone here speak Esperanto?
What did Tom have?
Tom was head over heels in love with Mary.
I'm not in any pain.
Don't be angry.
I read a book last night.
He did it for the good of the community.
You're not dead.
What's your favorite national park?
Tom opened the box and peeked inside.
If you really want to know, all you have to do is ask.
We know Tom was with you that night.
Picasso kept drawing pictures until he was 91 years old.
I would like to thank you for your collaboration.

The pain was almost unbearable.
We dislike violence.
Tom can't survive alone.
Tom sang with Mary.
She came to see me.
My hair is so messy!
This doesn't taste like pork to me.
This house has a heated swimming pool.
I have a high opinion of Tom.
I have nothing to declare.
I will start tonight.
Are you still living with your mom?
"Are you going to Tom's party?" "I'm still not sure."

You're surrounded.
How many people are you planning on calling?

This watch is waterproof.
I'm taking you home.
Remember these rules.
Children should be allowed to be children.
I've never met anyone who doesn't like chocolate.
You should go.
I think it's time for me to buy a house.
Tom wasn't greedy.
Don't expose it to the rain.
This fruit has a bad taste.
He got the short end of the stick.
It doesn't look good.
What do you base your theory on?
That's Tom's seat.
I hope you don't mind.

I'd rather walk than take a bus.
Don't forget that it's Tom's birthday tomorrow.
Tom ate the leftover pizza for breakfast.
What's Tom good at?
I'll have to think about that.
He is married with two children.
Tom could understand what Mary was trying to say.

It cost me 10 dollars.
I'm looking forward to seeing you in your wedding dress.
Do kids like you?
I don't put sugar in my coffee.
Bring it to me.
I'm an American citizen.
Finish this.
Please ask someone else.
Do you have a room of your own?
Sorry, but I have to work tonight.
I have some things in the hotel safe.

I need some relief.
She is lying about her age.

I take it you like Tom.
We sure don't want that.

Did you have a good sleep?
I'll call you soon.
Tom called the suicide hotline.
Where are your clothes?

Which is the best solution?
Tom is the only one here who doesn't know Mary.
Tom can't hurt you.
I called him up, but he wasn't there.
Tom is going to be thirty next year.
Did you see how he looked at me?
You're the first person I told that to.

Don't you miss anything?
Tom got a blanket and put it over Mary.
I would like to talk with you again.
What's the temperature?
Be quiet and listen to me.
My New Year's resolution is to learn how to play the ocarina.

Leave a message and I'll get back to you.
Tom knows that's no good.
You'd better call the doctor.
My house is your house.
We are aware of the error and are working on a solution.
You know it's not good.

Why should I pay?
I work at my friend's shop.
Take over.
The odds are in his favor.
It's difficult to balance a ball on your nose.

This is the core of the problem.
I'm not used to speaking in public.
Tom made pancakes for all of us.
It could be important.
Your uncle and I have known each other for many years.
You like him, don't you?
Tom clearly doesn't want to talk about it anymore.
That's basically what we want.
I know her by name, but not by sight.
I'm at my parents'.
She finally decided to separate from her husband.
He eats nothing other than fruit.
I think Tom did the best he could.
You aren't afraid of heights, are you?

If you don't want it, I'll eat it.
It stopped snowing an hour ago.
They are in the final part of the race.
He might have missed the last train.
I don't want to drink that.
He can't do it.
This is what I have been looking for.
Why don't you ask your teacher for advice?
Tom is just a friend of ours.
All sugar is sweet.
You're not the first person to say so.
It's your home.
Tom decided not to play dodge ball because he wasn't feeling well.
He's a high school student.
They gave it to me.
He gets along all right.

It is usually the islander who sees the mainland most clearly.
He had worked for the law firm for six years.
Love is not enough.
I need to see you immediately.
Excuse me for just one second.
Don't go yet.
I thought Tom was kidding me.
Peel the apple before you eat it.
What made Tom do that?
I lost my notebook today.
I want one!
I'm not sure about that. It depends.
It was hard as rock.
Tom rushed in.
One cannot do lots of things at the same time.
Tom seems to be tired.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
We should respect the right of others.
My mother got married at the age of twenty.
I haven't got rid of my bad cold yet.
We only use our basement for storage.

That was the first time that a man walked on the moon.
This door won't shut.
I'm not leaving until you tell me what I want to know.
I sure hope Tom doesn't do that.
She bought him a camera.
Would you like half of my sandwich?
Please close the door.
I don't think it matters.
I'm not worried about Tom. I'm worried about you, Mary.
Just do the essential repairs, please.
I don't do those things.
Tom rinsed the shampoo out of his hair.
I wouldn't ask Tom to do anything that he doesn't really want to do.
She came back an hour later.
Let's go outside and play in the snow.

Don't you have any money?
You don't know how that happened, do you?
The meeting will take place tomorrow.
We happened to meet at the station.
I need to help Tom.
Were you looking for Tom?
"What were you just doing?" "I was talking to Tom."
Tom wants a bigger discount.
He spoke more and more loudly.
Tom likes it when I do that.
Do you know where Tom and his friends went?
What time do we leave tomorrow?
Tom dealt the cards.
Nice to see you.
He made up that story.

I don't translate novels anymore.
You're a problem.
What is it you want to sell to us?
You are not permitted to bring dogs into this building.
"Have you seen Tom?" "Not in the last few days."
I know a few French songs.
Your story wasn't interesting.
Today is not your day.
In case you haven't noticed, I've been waiting for two hours.
What color are you going to dye your hair?
She has never been asked out on a date.
What's this about, Tom?
I just don't get it.
Whose books are those?

I've never felt this way before.
I can't change what happened.
I belong to a swimming club.
Tom had no idea what time Mary would get home.
I think I can help Tom with his homework.
She has a rich vocabulary of English words.
I said some things I wish I didn't.
Tom pumped up the tire.
I'm using a new computer.
Now I understand it all.
You have everything.
He lost his temper with me.
I spent the whole afternoon chatting with friends.
I was in prison for three years.
Both Tom and Mary blushed.
My friends won't talk to me anymore.
I think Tom said that.
Don't worry about your family.
Now don't you feel better?
Tom has a brother who is an architect.
What made Tom angry wasn't what you said, but the way you said it.
Do you have any vacant rooms?
The movie was a lot better than I expected it to be.
This one is ours.
I'm happy that Tom is here.
Let's see who can hold their breath underwater the longest.

Are we sure about that?

They're innocent men.
He will come home in a few days.
As soon as he saw the policeman, he ran away.
There is an apple on the desk.
This happened for a reason.
Without air we would die.
It sounds like having time alone has been good for you.
We can solve this problem easily.
Don't ask them where they are going.
I asked Tom where he got that.
He was exiled from his own country.
Don't hesitate to ask questions if you don't understand my explanation.
Let me finish eating my sandwich.
Tom's school day is divided into six periods.
It wasn't Tom's first time to hear Mary sing.
Thanks to your help, I could succeed.

Children grow up so quickly.
Tom is my husband's middle name.
Please tell me when he'll arrive here.
They don't need to do it right away.

I don't really think so.
I should've warned you that this might happen.
Why aren't Tom and Mary coming?
He is much older than he looks.
Tom sent for a doctor.
Did you come here to help me or not?
All in all, this was a nice party.
What's the meeting going to be about?
You need not worry about her.
I've heard that the most beautiful women in the world live in Boston.
The day is sure to come when your dream will come true.
That's avoidable.
I want a friend.
This is better than nothing.
Is this enough?
He put on his glasses and began to read.
Hi.
Have you ever seen Tom do that before?
Do you really want to wear that?
The economy is bad.
Tom likes to do things like that.
It's right up your alley.
Please show me what to do next.

We'll miss you, too.
Why are you pretending you don't know me?
You've known Tom a lot longer than I have.
We have large, medium, and small. What size do you want?
Yesterday it rained the entire afternoon.
I want to ask them when their wedding day is.
I could not understand anything he said.
How far along are you?
I'll help when I come back.
We simply have no choice.
I don't know if it is true.
We're planting seeds.
Tom was released from the hospital last month.
There were fifty passengers on the plane.
I mistook Mary for Alice.
What can have induced him to behave so cruelly?
The more I think about it, the less I like it.
To do him justice, we must admit that his intentions were good.
They kissed each other.
He often tells us we must help one another.
She scolded him because he left the door open.
I don't have any cash.
Won't you have another glass of milk?
You've done it!
I'm still working on that.
He armed himself with a pistol.
Why are we doing this again?
How many teams are there?
Have you ever seen a spider spinning its web?
The police commissioner said that he would in no way, shape, or form discuss the details of the matter, as it was the subject of ongoing investigations.
I tried writing with my left hand.
Tom is never late for school.
How is your cold?
Tom asked for my help.
I don't have a fever.
His wife was mad.
I don't like the way this is going.
You've been a great help.
I decided to become a doctor.
I regret what I said.
The suit's custom-made.
Let's go see Tom.
Tom stayed up all night studying.
What makes you think Tom isn't a native speaker?
Well, then, if you want me to I'll do it.
I'm horrible.
Each of them was given a prize.
I want to learn English.
Quit bothering me.
You gave it to us.
Tom is barely able to stay awake.
Find Tom.
I can't live without you.
We'll see to it.
This old car breaks down all the time.
Look me up sometime.
What're you reading?
Tom is feeling nauseous.
I'm coming to your party.
I don't deserve this.
The soldiers' mission was to destroy the bridge.
Are you going to the theater tonight?
Tom is extra careful.
I was also impressed with the school's cleanliness and the students' pride in it.
Half of the world’s population lives in cities.
I discovered something amazing.
What a dignified man!
Tom and I work together.
I don't like the way he speaks to me.
I want him to be informed about that in advance.
I guessed right in nine cases out of ten.
We didn't find a weapon.
He lost his balance and fell down.
The audience consisted mainly of students.
Tom scares easy.
She fainted, but came to after a few minutes.
I want a lawyer.
Please inform Tom.
Let's have breakfast.
Is this dog Tom's?
What was your name before you changed it?
I don't like cold coffee.
We have lunch at midday.
You're afraid of him, aren't you?
This work is beyond me.
There are fifty states in the United States.
He is very much interested in Japanese history.
Not everybody succeeds in life.
Tom is terminal.
I really liked your story.
That was a funny movie.
"Thank you, I'd love to have another piece of cake," said the shy young man.
The man confessed that he had robbed the old woman.
The girls whispered among themselves.
You have to take the first step.
Tom has just left.
What makes you say that?
I was disappointed because you weren't at home.
How long is that story?
Tom wanted people to like him.
Why didn't you say that before?
He walks fast.
Do you speak Chinese?
Alice will tell you that in Wonderland everything is topsy-turvy.
I'm not good at multitasking.
Tom asked me to throw the ball back to him.
I waited for her a long time.
Tom wrote me more than thirty messages yesterday.
I hurried in order not to be late for school.
I forgot my scarf.
Here are your keys.
Don't listen to him. He's just kidding.
Have you worked the puzzle out?
My wallet was stolen yesterday.
He has made me what I am today.
Someone has cut my kite string.
I can't get Tom to even talk to me.
I can't do a year's worth of work in three weeks.
When was the last time you missed the train?
Beat it.
Tom helped himself to a cup of coffee.
Why should I tell the truth if you won't?
He's really quick.
The police looked everywhere and couldn't find any trace of Tom.
Dental care is expensive.
Where's your favorite place to go when you want to be alone?
I fell asleep while reading a book.
Is anyone coming besides your friends?
I think he is right.
The wind was so strong, we were nearly blown off the road.
Tom solved the puzzle after Mary gave him a few hints.
Tom told Mary that he thought it wouldn't be good if she went there by herself.
I don't think you understand.
Tom really knows how to party.
It's already late.
Is your watch correct?
I thought I'd try eating Mexican food today.
Human beings are social creatures.
I can't finish this today.
We went to the zoo.
Where's my phone book?
I'll send you a postcard.
How long do I have?
It looks like snow, doesn't it?
Tom is the leader.
I don't think it's any of your business.
It's not your problem, anyway.
Tom took his reading glasses off.
You don't follow the rules.
Does she work in the kitchen?
My TV set is almost 15 years old, but it still has a good picture.
I have nothing further to say.
Tom waited until Mary was out of sight.
This shoe fits me well.
What's the time?
I can't fight any longer.
They hunted foxes.
She can't do without milk.
The fire destroyed three houses.
He was nearly hit by the car while crossing the street.
He told us an interesting story.
This is your last chance.
He was a Frenchman. I could tell by his accent.
He went back to Japan.
What's this?
A housewife should be economical.
I never saw him again.
He is a student.
I hope you aren't doing anything illegal.
How much should I tip?
We smell with our noses.
I'm a lot heavier than you.
Tom told Mary that she shouldn't walk alone after dark.
Were you at home last night?
Why did you decide to not go to Boston with Tom?
When are we going to use it?
What's the difference between Cantonese and Mandarin?
His book is very interesting.
We may never know what really happened.
Why are you waiting outside?
He looks old, but he hasn't reached 30 yet.
Instant noodles are a staple among college students.
We're going to make it.
That's a low blow.
I wish it didn't have to be like this.
Tom doesn't know who he should ask for advice.
Do you have some dental floss?
Tomorrow is Mother's Day.
I'll know tomorrow.
My car's over there.
I really enjoyed your company.
I like him.
Do you think this is too big?
I swept the kitchen floor.
It was only a joke.
"Tom will be here soon." "How soon?"
You should have accepted his advice.
He himself did it.
I used to think no one cared.
My grandfather is living on a pension.
I was planning on telling you.
Would you like some coffee?
Tom says he knows someone who's a good sketch artist.
We're cousins.
The number of tickets was limited.
Tom said that he was going to help.
You know where it is, don't you?
We talked about many things.
Ask him whether they still live in Tokyo.
The most beautiful flowers have the sharpest thorns.
What does your aunt do?
She wanted to get away from everyday life.
Tom does this for a living.
Tom said that you tried to kill him.
I have a thesis to write.
Let go of my arm.
What a funny man!
Not much has changed since then.
The patient is in critical condition.
It's about time you went to the barber's.
We were thinking of asking you to join our company.
He eats nothing but fruit.
My flight arrived at 2:30 p.m.
I can handle it.
If we were supposed to talk more than listen, we would have been given two mouths and one ear.
There are no tickets left.
It is up to you.
We've been there before.
Where did you buy your car?
Promise me you'll come back.
His house is three times larger than mine.
Mona is still running a temperature and should stay at home.
What does Tom have to say?
Tom is driving a rental car.
I'd like to go with you, but I'm broke.
He has begun to enjoy country life.
I have wonderful memories of Boston.
Tom was frank.
Are you talking to yourself?
Let's get it over with.
I want to want what you want.
What do you have in your bag?
Who did you learn French from?
If I were you, I'd follow Tom's advice.
There are no rules.
Tom started taking boxing lessons when he turned twelve.
Tom and Mary have almost nothing in common.
She has been studying French for a few years.
Tom didn't want it.
Japan today is not what it was even ten years ago.
I'll try to distract them.
Tom noticed Mary's car parked in front of the library.
Why don't you take off?
I'm not nervous.
Is Tom adopted?
You can't give up hope.
In times like this, we should all pull together.
Tom passed out from the pain.
The box was so heavy that I couldn't lift it.
To tell you the truth, I'm completely bored.
I want to become a doctor.
Has the mailman already come?
I know Tom likes basketball.
That's not fair.
Tom's speech was full of double entendres, most of which went over his audience's head.
Would you be interested in coming with us?
I can't understand this at all.
The boys are thirsty.
Where've you been?
Tom doesn't like to travel.
I won't do anything dumb.
You know what it's like.
Thank you for setting the record straight.
Tom is devoted.
We will have a music contest soon.
I did it because everyone else did.
It no longer matters.
I could kick myself for not inviting Tom and Mary to my party.
What would you have done in Tom's place?
The tires are very sticky.
I don't want the same thing to happen to us.
Why don't we call it a night?
I was going to write to you, but I started doing other things and forgot.
I don't want to be in your way.
She left the room without saying goodbye.
Why are girls so obsessed with clothes?
I don't know how to say what I want to say in French.
She can't stop me.
I refuse to answer.
Tom looked quite tired.
In Singapore, it is a crime to spit on the ground.
The bus has broken down.
We have to do without sugar.
I know you meant well.
If you look carefully, you'll see that the box has a false bottom.
Someone threw a rock at Tom.
I don't like warm winters.
That wasn't very romantic.
Did you see the new commercial?
You are irresistible.
I don't know exactly when I'll be back.
He is always trying to do the impossible.
The food wasn't that great.
Rainy season begins in June.
I've been to Boston a couple of times.
That child's easily distracted.
Tom has a lot of things to do.
I haven't felt like this since I was a teenager.
The doctor told Tom to reduce his red meat consumption.
If you follow this street, you will get to the station.
Tom will arrive in Boston at 2:30.
It is time for her to go home.
Tom did what most people would've done in the same situation.
Throw the dice.
That's a risk.
Tom continued to study French for another three years.
Father suddenly got sick and we sent for a doctor.
I don't think you're right.
Tom doesn't know Mary's telephone number.
Tom is a child prodigy.
Have you ever been to Canada?
This gun is out of bullets.
Please don't tell anybody.
I finished eating breakfast while Tom was getting ready for school.
Tom always stays in bed until noon on Sundays.
Tom is very good at chess.
Tom has to act now.
I've been watching you study.
One's lifestyle is largely determined by money.
What are they saying?
Tom and Mary got married a few years ago.
Call me this evening.
I'll sleep on the floor.
His name is known throughout this country.
I have a big brother.
How did you get that black eye?
Are there any questions?
Tom is correcting exam papers.
This makes me so sad.
How about going out for a drink after work?
I don't like novels without heroes.
You know I would never hurt you.
I don’t understand this poem.
Return this book as soon as you can.
It's been three days.
The paint hasn't dried yet.
Tom is getting a glass of water for me.
I couldn't help but laugh.
I walked the length of the street.
I always have room for dessert.
I came for you.
Tom is slender, isn't he?
Tom worries too much about his children.
The differences were minor, so I ignored them.
He fell into a deep sleep.
Tom took off his glasses and put them down on his desk.
Aren't you curious?
Let's go back to the motel.
Why don't you go in my place?
I am the laziest person I know.
Tom turned serious.
I don't understand.
This was Tom's idea.
I can teach English.
I had hardly left home when it began raining.
Tom climbed down from the roof.
You're sitting in my chair.
I'm 25 years old and I've never had a girlfriend.
I don't care who kisses Tom.
Will you show me what you bought?
Can you drive a five speed?
Her husband also wanted custody of the children.
Are you really that stupid?
It's not uncommon for people to give fake personal information when registering to use websites.
Your forehead's bleeding.
Can I see you in my office for a minute?
Tom's mother was a wise woman.
I'm looking forward to seeing you again.
Onions cook more quickly than potatoes.
I spent all my energy on that project.
There's almost no water in the bucket.
The cat is not dead.
I made a lot of money on the side.
Tom wants to declutter his home.
Tom looked away in horror as Mary doused her fries with mayonnaise on top of the ketchup.
That's the ugliest snowman I've ever seen.
He became a policeman.
Tom is looking at you.
Wow, it's pretty cold today.
I was not drunk.
He was robbed of all his money.
Would you please send me a catalogue by mail?
That country's economy is growing.
I don't know how I'll get home.
Did you mean this?
Tom is very cute.
She was so sad that she did not want to speak to anyone.
Are you still in love with your wife?
I'm worried about what'll happen if Tom doesn't come.
Do you live alone?
My client isn't saying another word.
The sun fades colors.
Why are you denying it?
We must water the flower.
Who do you have to do that with?
They have few books.
Expect to be pleasantly surprised.
He wore red pants.
Tom used old towels to dry the dog.
Where's Tom gone?
She sat in a chair reading a magazine.
Don't do that, OK?
Are they your friends?
Leave that stuff alone.
The town is in a mountainous district.
You should've said yes.
Let Tom answer.
I wondered whether Tom wanted to dance.
That's complicating the matter.
I want to hear the whole story.
Those are their books.
It has become quite common.
The police want to interrogate Tom.
Don't you think you should tell Tom about this?
I thought it was really cute.
What is it you'd like me to do?
Tom is in Boston with his parents.
The landscape is unfamiliar to me.
It is a lot of fun to listen to music.
I never use my camera anymore. I just take pictures with my phone.
Send the bill to my house.
Tom grimaced slightly.
The clock has stopped. A new battery is needed.
Sickness empties the wallet.
Tom and I swim together three times a week.
Can you tell me where Tom lives?
Tom complained that he didn't have enough time to read.
I can win.
There was a drop in temperature after the rain.
He shut the door.
I don't know where I'll live.
I don't have anything to say to any of you.
Tom saw a doctor.
Shut up and do as you're told.
That picture will amuse you.
Do you want to resign?
Tom got muddy playing football.
Do you mind if I join you?
Does this bus go to the Hilton Hotel?
Aren't they wonderful?
Tom made me come down here.
Jeans go with everything.
Everything is all right now.
This is not a good sign.
Tom went into the kitchen to get some coffee.
You should return what you borrow.
Tom is a scientist.
I haven't heard that word in a long time.
Tom fastened his seatbelt.
We should do this again.
I didn't see anyone studying.
Is anyone else hungry?
He is not qualified for the job.
I can't confirm that.
He winked at her.
We have walked all around the lake.
Many people lost their homes after the earthquake.
I found it in a cave.
I buy things that I know I am not going to use.
Is that supposed to happen?
Tom said he knew where the body was buried.
Education starts at home.
We're uninsured.
Please turn off the gas.
I would rather stay at home than go out in the rain.
How did you get into my house?
Tom was pretty young at the time.
Excuse me, but might I use the phone?
I like playing basketball.
What did Tom tell Mary not to do?
Hurry up! If you don't, we'll be late.
I agree with him.
We like Tom.
It is still as cold as ever.
She liked him right off.
The more, the merrier.
Drive cautiously.
I sure hope you're right.
Tom looks stunned.
Tom is always on my mind.
Do you know what this box is made of?
More tractors meant fewer horses and mules.
My boss has never invited me to her house.
No one uses that word anymore.
I saw my friend running up the stairs.
Where did you hide my cigarettes?
I just want a little more variety in my life.
Tom took a picture of himself and sent it to his girlfriend.
Where does Tom want to go?
The event made him famous.
Tom didn't want to do their dirty work.
Tom says that he needs to talk to you.
The police have Tom safely locked up.
I don't like where this is going.
We slept in the same bed.
Are you meeting someone here?
The man in charge of the merry-go-round decided to make sure everything was working properly.
Tom told his commanding officer that he wasn't willing to kill anyone.
You said almost all of your friends were Canadians.
Tom was perplexed.
I wasn't sure if you'd come or not.
Not everybody is the same.
Snow covered the bus.
I am fat.
Did it not occur to you to close the windows?
How many subscribers does this magazine have?
Tom looks lonely.
My girlfriend works at a language school and loves it very much.
The school rules require students to wear school uniforms.
Thanks for having me.
I thought you might be able to tell me how to do this.
The soldier gave his name.
It took only ten minutes to walk there.
You can trust him. He'll never betray you.
We have our orders.
I can't keep my eyes off of it.
Give me that iron ball.
I saw you looking.
You can still get that finished before 2:30.
It just didn't work.
I want to find out who did this.
Tom met Mary for breakfast.
I swear I didn't see Tom.
I'd like a double room.
It was in Kyoto that I first met her.
I know that this is important.
Even if I have to sell my house, I'll keep my business going.
Tom said he doesn't think Mary really wants to do that again.
I thought Tom was going to do that.
Mary received many gifts for her birthday.
Did you just call me Tom?
Tom talks very loud.
What do you guys think of Tom?
I feel like someone is watching me.
This works every time.
Though she was alone, I didn't think she was lonely.
I hope that no one saw you coming in here.
Bad drivers should have their licenses taken away from them.
It feels good, doesn't it?
I don't know anything about that.
I didn't try to go any further.
You may see Tom there.
I'll take you home.
At least I did something.
Are you sleeping, Tom?
I will arrive in four hours.
The air is damp.
Running as fast as she could, she still failed to catch the bus.
How do you know there aren't any?
Did you change your mind?
If you go by plane, you won't be able to take much luggage.
Step on it!
When she was abroad, she often used Skype.
I want Tom to see these.
The report cannot be true.
He doesn't need to get up so early.
There is no answer to your question.
I got a rash on my hands from dishwasher detergent.
You need to get ready.
I know why you aren't happy here.
Artificial leather can't compare with the real thing.
We are at home today.
Tom is objective.
Who said you could do that?
You have no fever.
The air mainly consists of oxygen and nitrogen.
Both buildings burned down.
My grandmother was a farmer.
Tom didn't see me.
Someone famous said that imagination is more important than intelligence.
How old do you think Tom is?
She might not know that we are here.
What in the world are you getting at?
Stop doing that, Tom.
We discussed the problem.
What have I done with my keys?
I believe this is mine.
The Japanese take their shoes off before entering their homes.
Please promise me you won't do that again.
His lecture had a large audience.
It's not enough to know only one language.
The meeting took place yesterday.
Tom lost his memory.
You know better.
What do you expect me to do?
When was the last time you wore your earrings?
I want to know what you think.
Tom and Mary were sitting on the sofa, watching TV.
My son can neither read nor write yet.
She stirred the soup with a spoon.
Tom broke into the deserted shack.
I'll ask Tom about it tomorrow.
I'm going to work during the spring vacation.
Tom doesn't remember where he put his keys.
I caught the flu.
She's smart and beautiful.
He asked me if I liked mathematics.
Well, then, if you want me to I'll do it.
Nice timing.
We'll never have to do this again.
I'm ashamed of my body.
I will be working all day tomorrow.
It's never going to happen.
Tom said he needed our help.
Did you enjoy the movie?
Did Tom bite you?
It's the thought that counts.
This is a little weird.
Do you want to talk?
Tom told Mary that he wanted to eat.
Tom will never believe that.
Tom is a good cook.
The street is wet and slippery.
I think you're working way too hard.
I got up very late this morning.
I'll go look.
Tom promised he'd be there, but he never showed up.
Tom is not too pleased.
I get the feeling you don't really want me to stay.
The less you know, the better.
We have to do this right away.
Tom is a very smart boy.
His Japanese is almost perfect.
Tom usually comes home after midnight.
Who would have thought back then that Tom had only seven years to live?
He had a strange dream.
Nobody else was there.
Who else uses it?
What is he up to now?
He dropped to his knees.
I dislocated my shoulder.
Let's get some lunch.
I just want you back.
Tom wasted no time.
My uncle lives in New York.
I saw Tom and Mary leave together.
Don't do anything rash.
The kids will love this video.
I love her so much that I can't leave her.
It is regrettable that you did not start earlier.
We could both go.
Don't ever come back here again.
I immediately accepted his offer.
I don't think we'll be able to solve this problem by ourselves.
Tom wouldn't eat.
Tom is upset.
How long were you at school today?
I think you'd better leave.
The group was made up of teachers and students.
She gave me a necktie which was completely to my liking.
Don't move till I get back.
I can't thank you enough.
"Just go in and tell the boss you want a raise." "That's easier said than done."
Who planned that trip?
Tom drank a beer.
She locked the door.
Let's rent a bike there.
I don't like it at all.
I also heard a similar story.
Tom worked there.
There was a car accident yesterday.
If it rains, please call me.

We seek happiness.
It is certainly possible if you want it.
Are those my earrings?

They took a leap of faith.
She smiled at her baby.
We caught some large fish there.
I'm more experienced than Tom.
Tom got to the bus stop just in time.
Tom wanted to know what happened.
Do you have anything less expensive?
You had better not go after dark.
Even though I disagree with what you say, I fully acknowledge your right to say it.
Tom and Mary have been married for three years.
You must read between the lines.
Let's begin with that question.
Does Tom like you?
I don't remember any of it.
I had a good time last evening.
If anyone has a problem, tell them to call me.
Tom is thinking of going to Boston next spring.
I gave Tom my word.
Tom doesn't spend much time thinking about money.
He can play tennis.
He gave the boy what little money he had.
I was born in 1988.
We must leave early.
It doesn't matter to Tom.
Do they sell notebooks at that store?
Is this our hotel?
Tom didn't leave.
This is the man whose daughter you met yesterday.
Tom is a boy scout.
They don't talk at all.
Tom doesn't really care whether he wins or not.

I don't have anything to do right now.
Tom knows that he'll be punished.
You can smell the ocean from here.
Tom has been a close friend of mine for a long time.
He's very fond of walking.

Do they know you're here?
She handed him the money that she owed him.

I'm glad you're pleased.
Perhaps I ought to tell Tom what happened.
Why don't you wear a dress?
The town has many narrow lanes.
I don't want to waste my money.
You should come with us.

Put the car into the garage.

Keep in mind that you must die.
Tom was completely devastated when he heard that Mary had been killed.
Tom asked Mary to open the window, but she wouldn't.
Do you have any quarters?

It costs an arm and a leg.
I don't care about the risk.
She dumped him for a richer man.
I don't want Tom to come.
Tom was crushed.
Work harder if you plan to succeed.
Tom is likely to still be in his office.
Don't make an enemy of Tom.
Tom needs to do that as soon as possible.
I have a headache this morning.
There is a small pond in our garden.
Many people are against the bill.

Please call me Tom.
How will Tom get out of that mess?
I tried to keep from crying.
Tom took the day off.
I want to win.
We want to live here.
How's the family?
I've tried.
Enjoy your evening.

The alarm went off at five-thirty.
She can sing better than anybody else in her class.

I'm afraid we have no choice.
There is nothing on earth that is not affected by the sun.
Tom answered in detail.
The only thing on the table that I normally wouldn't eat is that stuff on the yellow plate.
She's never fallen in love.
I can't go to the police with this.
Tom took home Mary's umbrella by mistake.

Tom finally got around to going to the dentist.
Few people live to be more than a hundred.
Tom passed a glass of milk to Mary.
Will you please call me this evening?
I think I've solved the problem.
She went home.
I have sinned.
I should've told you that you didn't need to buy any more sugar.
Tom doesn't seem to be aware of all the problems he's causing.
Come on, Tom. Let's go home.
Do you want to look at it?
I think that Tom lied to me.
I had nothing else to say.
Tom was upset because he wasn't invited to Mary's party.
Why do you say things like that?
If you won a million yen, what would you do?
What're you doing about this?
She likes to play the koto very much.
He went deaf as a result of an accident.
Tom should've been home from school hours ago.
We didn't have much rain last month.
Those chairs are in the way.
Tom doesn't seem to be paying attention.
Tom would like to be reincarnated as a woman.
It has started to rain.
Only my mother understands me.
Can you keep a secret?
Why did you say such a thing to him?
Tom watched in fascination.
That is the same color as mine.
Tom sat down on one of the stools.
What are you doing back there?
They even listened to music.
Tom wasn't rich.
Shouldn't I be there, too?
Have you noticed anything suspicious recently?
There is a river beside the house.
We want to talk to you about a problem.
Would you really do that for me?
Eventually the salesman persuaded me to buy the expensive machine.

It's just a little further.
They remained good friends.
I hope you change your mind.
Tom and Mary look healthy.
Tom is trying to understand.
I was up all night studying.
The food's ready.
You know how important this job is to me, don't you?
He owes me a lot of money.
Stop beating around the bush.
Jam comes in a jar.
I'd like to see my son.
You've lost too much blood.
You're even prettier than Tom said you were.
Do you want that warmed up?
The boy dug a grave for his dog that had died.
All the doctor's efforts were in vain and the man soon died.
You were right about everything.
Tom has a daughter who's married to an Australian.
He sold all that he owned.
It's time to go to school.
He comes from Wales.
I really missed you.
Tom took his time reading the contract.
He's active and fit.
Tom climbed the tree in our front yard.
Why don't you try it? Maybe you'll like it.
I just found out last week.
You're not working here anymore.
He isn't afraid of death.
Mary had never worn a sari before.
Tom said that isn't the only reason.
They called.
I'm at the airport now.
The thieves opened the door with a pass key.
Let's go!
I know Tom isn't your boyfriend.
If it were not for your help, I could not succeed.
It would be nice if I could travel to Japan.
The population of Yokohama is larger than that of Osaka.
Tom won't respond.
I just started reading this book.

I must know the truth.
I'm sure he'll pass the next exam.
Boil some water.
The boy has a watch in his hand.
There's a safe somewhere in Tom's house.
Let me ask you a question.
Tom reminds me of John.
The room is furnished with two beds.
We don't have time to process all this data.
That experiment led to a great discovery.
They don't want us to see what they're doing.
I know what you're planning to do.
After all we had done, he was still ungrateful.
Will you please call me a taxi?
"Tom and Mary have been divorced for over three years." "Really? I had no idea."
Tom's the kind of person who calls a spade a spade and a lot of people don't like that.
The customers have been complaining a lot lately.
The bread is fresh.
From year to year, pollution is worsening.
There is no one there.
The committee is discussing social welfare.
Tom is training for a marathon.
My parents wouldn't allow me to do that.
Tom couldn't get his car to start.
He came back not because he was homesick, but because he was running short of money.
I want to go on a trip with you.
I've crossed the Atlantic several times.
Tom asked me to do that.
I don't tolerate incompetence.
Tom is the father of three children.
How long does it take to your office from the airport?
"Could you move over a little?" "Oh, sorry. I didn't realize I was taking up so much space."
I have to give a class tomorrow at 2:30.
Just make sure you give this to Tom.
Is that answer right?
Tom wondered what Mary would say if she knew he had spent the past week in Boston with Alice.
Tom wanted to sit next to Mary.
Don't say such things.
Tom lost seventy pounds.
I will do my best in everything.
She doesn't have any friends.
There is a church across the street.
Have you eaten supper yet?

These apples aren't ripe yet.
Do one thing at a time.
Tom worked in the garden for a long time.
I need some fresh air.
I'm really bad at doing stuff like this.
Tom now wears a wig.
Tom's father is in jail.
The serial killer was cold and distant during his trial, and appeared unaffected by the fact that he had murdered so many people.
Nobody cares what you think.
You don't need to worry about Tom.
I've got to go back to Boston tomorrow.
What did you wear?
I'm not happy to be here.
Tom's new girlfriend is a vegetarian.
Driving during a storm can be dangerous.
I'm going with Tom to Boston.
You say I should know him quite well, but as a matter of fact, I was introduced to him only last week.
He did it while he was drunk.
How did you know that Tom wouldn't show up on time?
Can I go to work?
I don't like the way Tom cooks vegetables.
They're to blame as well.
I like President Obama.
The prisoner was set free yesterday.
Tom is available.
Tom and I are afraid.
Who is your favorite player?
That's pretty impressive.
Tom picked up the saltshaker and salted his eggs.
Long time, no see.
I teach biology and French.
I can't remember the last time I saw you so happy.
Aren't you looking for Tom?
"What's your name?" "Tom," the little boy said shyly.
I would like that.
You may enter now.
"Can Tom play the trumpet?" "No, but he's a pretty good singer."
That's what I love about you, Tom.
The people of America fought for their independence.
What actually happened?
He's photogenic.
At least the sheets are clean.
All is fair in love and war.
What newspaper do you read?
He can hardly walk.
Can anyone tell me the time?
Is it true that Tom has a twin?
Where is the changing room?
The house where Tom lives is in the old part of the city.
Nobody believes me.
Tom is just a little nervous.
Does Tom know that you know?
Tom is waiting to speak to Mary.
Thanks for staying with me.
I was in London most of the summer.
He earns over 500 dollars a month at that job.
We'll leave as soon as you are ready.
That'd be impossible.
We laughed about it.
What are you drinking?
The legs of the table are shaky.
What a beautiful morning!
Let's get together in my office.
Tom resigned this week.
Tom is smiling at the baby.
They're doing great.
Don't look at it.
Do we have any French homework that needs to be turned in tomorrow?
Let's hope that common sense prevails.
There's nobody in the house. Everybody's outside.
There was a cat on the table.
He had a book in his hand.
He hit me on the head.
Many trees lose their leaves in the winter.
I'd like to pay by check.
Paris, which is on the Seine, is a beautiful city.
The two regions differ in religion and culture.
You are rich.
Tom warned Mary what would happen if she did that.
Do you prefer white rice or brown rice?
The girl resembles her mother.
I'm ready when you are.
Tom doesn't remember Mary.
I have no idea where she lives.
Do you have any idea who did it?
May I join you?
Would you like another helping?
Which countries have you visited?
I subscribed to a newspaper.
Do you think Tom has a drug problem?
I need to renew my subscription.
If it's a simple tune, I can sight-sing it.
We had fun shopping.
Do you want to go to the movies tomorrow?
Tom works as a bank clerk during the week and as a part-time lifeguard on weekends.
Expensive meals can't compensate for lack of sleep.
I don't want to be rich.
Do you know where Tom is?
Tom appreciated Mary's help.
Have you made up your mind yet?
What's the best way to get to the airport from here?
Look what I've found.
I can't figure out why he did it.
Stop criticizing me!
Tom plays guitar in a heavy metal band.
There is nothing to prevent my going.
He drank a beer.
Tom turned around suddenly.
The beautiful woman is kind.
Scores of people gathered in front of the Royal Palace.
I'm starting to lose my patience.
She dyed her hair blonde.
I thought it was really bad.
I'm sorry, I don't have change.
What do you feed your dog?
Many Americans blamed Spain.
I know what they are thinking.
You do look a little better today.
I don't know where Tom is going.
I was waiting for you.
We don't have any proof.
If you'd known then what you know now, what would you have done differently?
You're my only real friend.
Why didn't you help Tom?
Tom knows I know.
I used to feed my dog twice a day.
My computer won't start up anymore.
The mother laid her baby on the bed softly.
What do you think about eating out tonight?
Most Americans do not object to my calling them by their first names.
I'm sure you already know what to do.
Mary didn't have a husband.
Tom smiled at Mary.
Tom studied philosophy at the university.
Are you telling me how to do my job?
I have been looking for you.
I am playing volleyball now.
You have to find Tom.
Tom doesn't know how to start a lawn mower.
It already has taken me hours.
Tom and Mary are very old friends.
Why aren't you already on board the ship?
I made supper.
Did you leave the door open?
I will not go unless it stops raining.
This is very impressive.
Keep it simple, Tom.
My sister is having a baby in June.
We just had to deal with it.
He was dead wrong.
Is she gone?
Tom grew up without running water.
Who's coming for dinner?
Would you please lock the door?
Tom's dog slobbered on his pillow.
That's upsetting.
Tom and his friends painted the barn yesterday.
If anyone can do it, you can.
Women don't like me.
I wish I had been with her then.
I was there last night.
I've never seen you like this.
Tom struggled to keep his eyes open.
Tom has just proposed to Mary.
Tom put on his headphones.
Tom is the only man that Mary has ever loved.
How was the beach?
There isn't any film in this camera.
This metal is called zinc.
The boy playing the guitar is my brother.
Tom's barely coping with his workload at the moment.
Tom bought a bucket of extra-spicy fried chicken and a container of coleslaw.
If you don't want it, I'll eat it.
A pretty girl like you will definitely be noticed.
I'm satisfied with these results.
What's your favorite toothpaste?
That was different.
He is unsatisfied with the result.
Where is your cap?
Tom couldn't sneak out of the dorm without being seen.
Give your carpet to that person.
I paid to have this done.
It's difficult to peel chestnuts.
There's no doubt about that.
I have to dress up.
People living in town don't know the pleasures of country life.
I give my word.
We'd better just call it a day.
I'm a little angry with you.
Is there anything in the box?
I did not take many photos.
Don't you want to go to Boston?
Can you tell me what Tom did?
She went on working.
What's your decision?
He fought until the end.
Tom didn't think Mary would catch a fish.
I can't eat chocolate.
Why did Tom want you here?
I will find a way to repay you.
Tom got right to the point.
He earns three times as much as me.
I've learned a lot of things from Tom.
Did you find your contact lenses?
Isn't it cool?
Why isn't Tom at home?
She wasn't able to contact him by phone.
Tom is from Boston, but now he lives in Chicago.
He helped me to get over the difficulties.
I've got bad news for you.
You must clear the table.
Tom seldom listens to music at home.
Tom told me a really funny joke this morning.
You have only to touch the button.
He stole my watch.
You always destroy everything.
I'm thirty now.
Your idea is definitely worth thinking about.
I'm tired of your complaints.
The committee has ten members.
Are things going well?
This fish is not fit to eat.
It's time for us to start thinking about how we can improve the situation.
They left the problem unsolved.
Tom is by no means unintelligent. He is just lazy.
He answered incorrectly.
Give me a hug.
I have a lot of friends in Boston.
She takes private piano lessons.
Tom won't be able to do anything about the problem this week.
I have a lot of work to do today.
Tom's car died on him in the middle of the intersection.
You will always be welcome.
I wasn't expecting you so soon.
Is it there?
A fool and his money are easily parted.
How is the weather?
She was the first one to help him.
All you have to do is write it down.
Tom gave the book back to Mary last week.
She requested help, but no one came.
I know what to look out for.
The view is beautiful beyond words.
I hate carrots even more than I hate onions.
Bananas are delicious.
I want to run.
The city hall is located at the center of the city.
Tom began to panic.
Tom says Mary is broke.
Tom has a hunch.
Few scientists understand the theory of relativity.
Tom jumped out of bed as soon as the alarm clock went off.
What do you hope to find here?
This is useless.
You don't have to say anything you don't want to say.
Our advice is that the company invest in new equipment.
I think it's wrong to lie.
He had no sooner arrived than he was asked to leave.
My mother lives a lonely life in the country.
Did you invite Tom?
The longer we waited, the more impatient we became.
Kyoto is visited by many people every year.
I think it's good.
I feel blue.
Tom is an archaeologist, isn't he?
I wonder whether or not Tom's daughter is pretty.
You don't know that.
I didn't go to school last Monday.
I wanted to do that with you.
There's no cure for baldness.
Don't pay any attention to what he tells you.
We should know the result by Thursday.
I am leaving for Tokyo tomorrow.
This book is very good.
How did you make it?
The cheesecake tasted too sweet.
Tom is the one who told me that I should study French.
Why do I have to give this to you?
He behaved like a child.
Tom never works on Sunday.
I'd like you to help me do that.
Call me if there's a change.
The cat doesn't look happy to see us.
How's the world treating you?
Tom is allergic to dust.
Thanks for having me here.
Is he looking at me?
The soldiers opened fire.
I was watching TV at this time yesterday.
I think Tom knows why Mary isn't here.
How's your French coming?
This is a collector's item.
The old man tripped over his own feet.
That's not what we want.
Tom and Mary named their daughter Alice.
I love movies.
He swims in the river.
The water was five feet deep.
Tom thought Mary was right.
Do you have a similar proverb in French?
The proposal came up last week.
Are you trying to impress me?
Do you really love me?
Tom doesn't want to lose Mary.
You don't have to worry about a thing like that.
Tom couldn't keep his mind off Mary.
Everybody sang at the top of their lungs.
I don't have a care in the world.
Tom is fasting.
He just missed the bus.
Let us out.
I'm not going to say it again.
The consumer price index has been fluctuating wildly.
I'm still job hunting.
Open this door.
I know what I want. I just haven't found it yet.
Don't leave them alone.
You're unlucky.
Tom's smarter than we are.
Has Tom ever asked you to lie for him?
They both like the same girl.
Their father had a large shoe shop in the town.
He is similar to his father.
I haven't seen Tom in ages.
Is there something we can do for you?
How did you enjoy the concert?
Painters such as Picasso are rare.
Tom and Mary played together almost all day.
It's up to you.
I just spoke to Tom.
Tom says he's not guilty.
She's already rich even though she's only 26 years old.
When we told Koko the news, she was silent for about ten minutes.
Can you cook a meal?
You must not speak Japanese during the class.
Tom made himself a cup of tea.
Do you know who you’re talking to?
Tom still has a flip phone.
I've known him ever since he was a child.
Where's the cook?
Tom did what he promised me he'd do.
Have you ever grown a beard?
That's what you're good at.
I can't just pretend nothing happened.
Tom turned the music off.
Be at the station at eleven on the dot.
How did you know that Tom was planning to eat at that restaurant last night?
I like women but I don't get along with them.
I was dialing his number just as he walked through the door.
Young people tend to complain about everything.
We can't be sure of what happened to Tom.
The judge sentenced him to a jail term of five years.
He has two aunts on his mother's side.
What an interesting theory!
Tom paid the bill and left the restaurant.
Tom eats less than Mary does.
Tom saw you.
I'd like to ask you about Tom.
How did you come by this painting?
I don't agree with you on this point.
She missed him a lot.
He's the love of my life.
Tom doesn't seem to be as busy as Mary is.
Tom kept me waiting for more than 30 minutes.
The cat slowly approached the mouse.
I'm humming.
They attempted to escape.
I'm Tom's assistant.
Don't worry. I'll protect you.
Tom was thirsty.
Everyone prayed.
You're afraid of him.
I bet you can't catch me.
I don't know how old Tom is now.
I recommend you to go by train.
I ate as little as possible.
Tom is hunting for a job.
Your friends will miss you.
Where's the bank?
Tom was too tired to do anything.
We're trying our best to do it.
He came back home a while ago.
I didn't go out last Sunday.
The old man told me a strange story.
We talked until two.
I have written a letter.
Tom usually plays a drum solo at least once every time his band gives a concert.
He works like a maniac.
We'll give it a shot.
I played football.
You seem to know a great deal about Tom.
I just want a little more sleep.
This bed is very comfortable.
I'll give you this money.
The market was flooded with foreign goods.
You're really gifted.
This vending machine is out of order.
I've got a surprise for you.
I like doing that.
This radio is out of order.
I'm a Japanese teacher.
You have a task to complete.
Why don't you just forget it?
The children washed their feet.
We have a lot of problems to deal with.
She walks.
Beijing is the capital of China.
Tom asked Mary what her plans for the future were.
Tom was asleep on the couch, snoring loudly.
You were always such a happy boy.
Tom looked deeply into Mary's eyes and smiled.
I'm not cleaning that up.
I am very sensitive to heat.
She dumped him for a younger man.
Personally, I think it would be a mistake to hire Tom.
Some people in the world suffer from hunger.
I'm very sleepy now.
Did she have any weapons on her?
Would you like to sit?
How are you going to convince Tom?
Are they gone?
You were a soldier during the war, right?
Please take off your hat.
You have to overcome the difficulties.
We have to consider the problem in the light of cultural differences.
I was afraid of Tom.
With the coming of spring, everything is gradually coming to life again.
He must be stopped at all costs.
This is crazy.
I caught sight of her at Shibuya.
In the summer, it dawns earlier than in the winter.
I don't think we were followed.
Tom persuaded Mary to join our band.
Have another cup of coffee.
Tom felt that there was no need to hurry.
You're better off without me.
What would you do in this situation?
Tom is a very close friend, but he's not my boyfriend.
I want to be treated with respect.
It is man's lot to suffer.
She is busy cooking dinner.
Did you check this?
I don't know what you're looking for.
Tom was just looking for you.
Tom speaks French better than any of the other students in his class.
They won't believe me.
My sister didn't help me.
I thought you were going to talk to Tom about it.
He looks his age.
The economy of Japan is still stable.
Does anyone know where Tom went?
This job pays 10,000 yen a day.
I think they did that on purpose.
You'll get into trouble if your girlfriend finds out the truth.
You ought to know better.
He appreciates Japanese culture.
You seem very knowledgeable about that.
I'm here to take you home.
We play soccer every Saturday.
I wanted to talk to you because I need your help.
I saw you crying.
Tom drank a lot yesterday.
I never thought it would happen to me.
Please hurry! Tom is waiting.
She fell in love with a prince.
You ought to know better at your age.
He doesn't like any sport.
Are you close to your family?
The birds flew to the south.
I paid 1,500 yen for this dictionary.
Tom sat in the shade.
Tom is a little overweight.
Are you accusing us of price gouging?
His illness resulted from drinking too much.
I think Tom is sharp.
Be careful.
What's Tom doing in there?
There's no reason to complain.
Today's Tom's birthday.
Come on down here.
Tom showed Mary around the office.
A very handsome prince met an exceptionally beautiful princess.
Are you feeling better today?
I can vouch for Tom's work. He is really good at what he does.
Tom was overwhelmed by the amount of work he had to do.
Tom opened the safe.
Excuse me for interrupting you.
I'll pick you up after school.
I helped.
Most of the people working here are unpaid volunteers.
We're closed.
Tom and Mary seem to be suited for each other.
Tom was lying on the pier getting a suntan.
Two children were playing on the road.
He was very busy all day.
I don't fear death.
He jumped over a ditch.
I can't dance either.
Tom is helping.
There's a guy in there with a gun. I need backup.
Tom had difficulty learning French.
Tom wore gloves.
Even if it should rain, I will start tomorrow.
I don't want Tom seeing this.
Mary is so pretty.
Let's not argue anymore.
I don't remember where I put my sunglasses.
She took a deep breath and then started to talk about herself.
When did you pass the exam?
What size do you wear?
He was moved to tears when he heard the news.
Tom made several corrections.
I have absolute trust in you.
Tom could've left early if he'd wanted to.
There's no need to worry.
I let Tom in the house.
There was an earthquake and, in addition, there was a tsunami.
It pays to be polite.
We can't help Tom.
The milk has a bad taste.
Learning a foreign language is interesting.
I may be crazy, but I'm not stupid.
Why do you feel that way?
I'd like to offer you a job.
Why did you poison Tom?
Tom sat down next to Mary and they began talking to each other.
That's a good thing.
I heard you scream.
Have you eaten dinner yet?
Go along this street and turn right at the bank.
What's the minimum wage in Australia?
What time will you arrive tomorrow?
